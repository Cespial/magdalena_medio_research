This study investigates the impact of armed conflict on educational outcomes by using a three-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) to analyze students’ academic performance at the municipal school and individual levels. Data were gathered for the years 2002, marked by the highest conflict intensity, and 2017, the lowest conflict intensity following the peace agreement. A municipal-level conflict intensity index was created by integrating data on homicides, forced disappearances, kidnappings, displacement, and the recruitment of minors, resulting in a more accurate assessment of violence in each municipality. The enrollment of conflict victims at the school level captures the direct impact of violence on students, serving as an additional lens through which to assess the conflict's influence on educational outcomes. The measure of academic performance was the Saber 11 results, Colombia's national large-scale assessment program, which evaluates all graduating high school students in core competencies, including reading, quantitative reasoning, science, English as a Foreign Language (EFL), and civics and citizenship. The findings reveal a significant impact of violence on educational outcomes in both years. Additionally, while the enrollment of conflict-affected students negatively predicted academic performance in 2002, this effect was not significant in 2017, despite a higher proportion of victimized students enrolled in schools. The results also align with previous research indicating that female students, those from low socio-economic backgrounds, and those attending public or rural schools consistently perform at lower levels. In contrast, male students, those from wealthier families, private schools, and urban areas tend to achieve higher educational outcomes. This research enhances the understanding of how armed conflict influences education and provides evidence to guide targeted interventions, particularly in post-conflict regions. The findings aim to inform strategies for conflict prevention and resolution within Colombia's educational system, supporting equitable and resilient learning environments. © 2025 The Authors","Armed conflict; Colombia; Education; Multilevel analysis; Open data; Youth","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008585116"

In the feature, we propose a broad understanding of environmental peacebuilding that takes all cycles of the peacebuilding process into account and puts stronger emphasis on the long-term social and environmental impacts. Based on this conceptualization, the contributions to this special feature analyze a series of environmental, social, political, and economic dimensions of post-conflict environmental peacebuilding processes in a diversity of geographical contexts. Building on a wide mix of methods from various disciplinary angles, the feature provides the reader with a range of important and novel results: on different types of impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods (e.g., largely detrimental consequences across Uganda or for environmental human rights defenders in Colombia as a whole, but also decreasing deforestation in Colombia’s Sumapaz territory); for various timings and cycles of peacebuilding processes (e.g., ongoing violent conflicts around Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Iraq’s Kurdistan region, a recent truce in Tigray in late 2022, less than a decade of peacebuilding in Colombia, and over 20 years since the peace agreement in Uganda); at different political levels (from local areas like DRC’s Virunga region or Colombia’s Sumapaz area to national politics and international law contexts); and for a large set of actors (such as local farmers, indigenous communities, civil society groups, rebel groups, and local and national governmental actors). One core overarching finding across these contributions is the dominance of nature-neglecting, instrumentalizing and extractivist narratives with their far-reaching impacts on post-conflict societies. These impacts are not only environmental, e.g., deforestation and biodiversity loss, but also social, in the form of threats to livelihoods of vulnerable communities, and they re-produce old but create also new forms of physical, structural, and cultural violence. © 2025 by the author(s).","","","Editorial","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105021438642"

Public policy can play a crucial role in combating tropical deforestation, yet gaps in policy formulation, operationalisation, and implementation can hinder its effectiveness. There is currently a lack of detailed analysis on policy gaps, especially concerning tropical deforestation. Our study analysed the policy gaps in a deforestation frontier in the Colombian Amazon during the post-conflict period to enhance our understanding of why public policies might be inadequate in curbing deforestation. This analysis involved identifying potential gaps in the formulation, operationalisation, and implementation of a major national policy framework aimed at controlling deforestation in Colombia. To identify and delineate these policy gaps, we combined secondary literature on deforestation drivers, existing databases, institutional capacity analyses, and national statistics. Our findings indicate that land speculation, a power vacuum, the expansion of pastures, cattle ranching, and infrastructure development are driving tropical deforestation in the study area. Additionally, this process of deforestation is linked to systemic and structural challenges in institutional capacity, broadening policy gaps, such as the exclusion of the main drivers in policy formulation, a lack of local capacity and resources for policy implementation, diverging visions and preferences for regional development, centralisation, and policy obsolescence, which affect both policy operationalisation and implementation. Based on these identified gaps, we discuss potential policy interventions to address them in the study area and other tropical regions. © 2025 The Authors","Environmental policy; Guaviare; Land grabbing; Land speculation; Land tenure; Land use/cover change; Landscape transformation","deforestation; environmental policy; land cover; land tenure; land use change; landscape change; literature review; policy approach; policy implementation; regional development; regional planning; tropical forest; tropical region; Amazonia; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011200049"

The study aims to understand local land use change by incorporating human perceptions as proxies for factors associated with underlying socioeconomic drivers of deforestation in post-conflict priority areas. Community perceptions of socioeconomic dimensions such as education, health, infrastructure, and peacebuilding, among others, were gathered from 98 groups of villages in the Antioquia region of Colombia. This information was categorized and weighted to create three perception-based outlooks: Optimistic (primarily marked by opportunities); Pessimistic (primarily marked by problems); and Neutral. Annual deforestation rate (ADR) data was generated from Landsat imagery, while biophysical and accessibility data came from official sources. Generalized additive models were used to assess the relationship between deforestation and biophysical and socioeconomic factors. The findings indicate that Optimistic outlooks on infrastructure and land adaptation were associated with a 22.59 % lower ADR compared to Neutral ones. Conversely, Optimistic outlooks of housing and sanitation topics were associated to a 19.65 % higher ADR compared to Pessimistic outlooks. Meanwhile, Pessimistic outlooks on reconciliation and peacebuilding topics were associated with a 22.09 % lower ADR than the Neutral. For biophysical factors, temperature differences above 1.4 °C and precipitation differences between 60 and 100 mm were associated with ADR of 1.8 % or higher. Regarding accessibility, the greater the distance to tertiary roads, the lower the ADR, which was below 0.6 % from 5 km onwards. Our approach of combining perceptions with biophysical data provides new insights into the factors associated with the underlying drivers of deforestation at a local level. This provides guidance on which to base land-use policies to protect the region's forests, such raising awareness of the value of forests and fostering community links with them. This approach can be adapted to similar contexts to provide new insights on how human perceptions of socioeconomic dimensions relate to deforestation at scales where data is not yet available. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Community participation; Forest; Land use change; Post-conflict; Public policy; Territory","accessibility; deforestation; housing; infrastructure; land use change; land use planning; Landsat; local participation; peace process; perception; political conflict; precipitation (climatology); sanitation; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; Antioquia [Colombia]; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010533241"

The Amazon foothills are a territory of contrasts between natural abundance and various socio-environmental problems. Ethnic and peasant communities –and particularly women– have been the primary victims of these conflicts, which have exacerbated inequality gaps that prevent these communities from achieving adequate levels of well-being, including food security. Objectives. To determine the prevalence of food insecurity and identify the socioeconomic factors associated with its occurrence in two municipalities of the Andean-Amazon piedmont: San José del Fragua y Curillo. Materials and methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity in communities of two municipalities in the southwest of Caquetá, using the Escala Latinoamericana y Caribeña de Seguridad Alimentaria. One hundred eighty-nine surveys were applied to households in the municipalities of Curillo and San José del Fragua. Results. Only 23.3% of the households declared food security, while 30.2% experienced moderate and severe food insecurity. Statistically significant associations were found between food insecurity and affiliation to the healthcare system, level of education, and self-recognition as a victim of the armed conflict. Conclusions. In these peasant populations, the high prevalence of food insecurity was associated with vulnerable socioeconomic conditions. The studied municipalities showed prevalence rates higher than the national average, reflecting marginalization and inequality related to the armed conflict, limited access to markets, and displacement of the agricultural vocation. These factors align with the country's sustained increase in food insecurity, even after the signing of the Peace Agreement. © (c) 2025 Biomedica.

Results: Our findings reveal persistent spatial clustering, with displacement, violence, and disasters becoming increasingly concentrated over time, particularly in regions historically inhabited by Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities. We also find strong spatial correlations between these factors, with violence emerging as the primary driver of displacement, especially in the years following the 2016 Peace Agreement. At the same time, certain areas exhibit persistently low levels of displacement, highlighting the uneven geographic distribution of these processes.

The peace agreement reached in 2016, with the demobilisation of important illegal armed groups, opened new opportunities for economic development, but it has also brought challenges to public health. Formerly inaccessible areas controlled by illegal armed groups, which remained almost untouched by human disturbance, have opened to several human activities such as agriculture, livestock farming, and ecotourism. These activities have increased disrupting ecosystems and wildlife habitats, promoting contact with wildlife, creating conditions for the spillover and emergence of zoonotic pathogens, mainly those associated with acute undifferentiated febrile illness since most of the country is tropical and sub-tropical. Although some studies have shown the circulation of zoonotic febrile illnesses, the presence of unrecognized and potentially highly virulent zoonotic pathogens in the country remains a concern, since areas that were once isolated still lack proper healthcare infrastructure and surveillance systems. This narrative review explores how the end of the armed conflict in Colombia may have influenced the emergence of zoonotic pathogens, while examining related challenges and proposing potential solutions to address these concerns. © 2025","Acute undifferentiated febrile illness; Armed conflict; Colombia; Emerging infectious diseases; Health challenges; Post-conflict; Zoonoses","economic development; environmental impact; human activity; infectious disease; pathogen; peace process; social conflict; acute febrile illness; agricultural worker; agriculture; Colombia; communicable disease; controlled study; female; fever; habitat; human activities; human impact (environment); infectious agent; livestock; major clinical study; review; war; wildlife; zoonosis; animal; epidemiology; human; microbiology; Animals; Armed Conflicts; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Humans; Zoonoses","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007164421"

The edaphic and climatic conditions of much of Colombia's arable land support an agroindustry-based economy, generating substantial amounts of residual biomass. This article evaluates appropriate technologies to convert biomass into electricity in three isolated areas (IAs): Amazon, Orinoco, and Pacific. The technical potential of agricultural residues (AR), livestock waste (LW), and municipal solid waste (MSW) was evaluated, and a total estimate of 3870.5 MW was obtained. Technologies considered were conventional Rankine cycle (CRC), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and cycle with internal combustion engine cycle (ICE.C), with power outputs from 50 to 50 000 kW, investment costs from 2100 to 5120 USD/kW, and levelized electricity costs from 0.074 to 0.252 USD/kW. To match the per capita electricity consumption of the rest of the country, the estimated energy demand in these isolated areas was 380.2 MW. This corresponded to 3.3% of the theoretical energy potential of agricultural waste biomass in those areas. Converting waste biomass into electrical energy is an option for the farming sector, as it would allow it to manage its waste more efficiently and add value.

In parallel, Colombia was committed to implement the global environmental agendas, including efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by reducing deforestation in the Amazon. Campesino communities in Colombia have historically been marginalized and pushed into forested lands and protected areas. This study seeks to understand the configuration of land-use conflicts in the Amazon Forest Reserve Zone (AFRZ)-a land management category in the Colombian Amazon-amid the implementation of the global environmental agendas and the Peace Agreement, with a focus on the environmental justice implications for peasant communities. After undertaking a historical review of peasant colonization of the Amazon, we focus on the administration of the former president Iván Duque (2018-2022) in which military operations were deployed to counteract the increase of deforestation. These operations resulted in the destruction of private and community infrastructure, and the stigmatization, criminalization, and even homicide of rural inhabitants. Militarization is only the most obvious of the conservation strategies that limit access to nature by peasants, who depend on it for their livelihoods. We further explore the environmental justice implications of this military conservation approach through a case study in the village El Camuya, located in San Vicente del Caguán (Caquetá), in the Colombia’s “arc of deforestation”. Using qualitative methods, we demonstrate how the Comprehensive Rural Reform included in the Peace Agreement has been insufficient to fulfill the needs of Amazonian peasants and that, when intersecting with the environmental agendas, it has fostered land use conflicts that can be understood as environmental injustices. © 2025 by Forest and Society.","Amazon rainforest; Deforestation; Environmental justice; Militarization of conservation; Peasants","conservation management; deforestation; environmental justice; forest management; nature conservation; nature reserve; rainforest; Amazonia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008250187"

It assumes that the post-FARC scenario of armed agents needs to be observed as a complex adaptive system where several types of armed structures come together.

If these initiatives also account for environmental aspects, they have the potential to address both ecological damages and resource-related conflict causes. The sprawling literature on environmental peacebuilding therefore stresses the need for a holistic perspective to study conditions for sustainable peace. Recent scholarly work has directed attention to peace trajectories that draw connections between political, socioeconomic, and environmental dimensions of peacebuilding processes. We contribute to this growing research field by synthesizing key findings from the inter-disciplinary research program the “Nature of Peace” and related studies. Our goal is to identify, explain, and understand the trajectories that environmental peacebuilding processes may take in societies after an internal armed conflict. We first introduce the theory-based analytical framework that guided our studies. Based on this, we study trajectories that lead from the integration of environmental concerns in peacebuilding efforts to environmental and social consequences of these efforts and to chances for sustainable peace. We apply this framework to a range of geographical contexts, drawing, inter alia, on Colombia since the signing of the peace agreement in 2016, and environmental peacebuilding efforts in Uganda since 2002. We find that both constellations of power and dominant narratives considerably shape the routes that environmental peacebuilding may take. In particular, dominant nature-neglecting, instrumentalizing, and extractivist narratives have far-reaching impacts on the trajectory of peace processes. This is not only with regard to their environmental implications, e.g., deforestation and biodiversity loss, but also social consequences, e.g., threats to livelihoods of vulnerable communities, and, ultimately, old and new forms of physical, structural, and cultural violence. Thus, although addressing power asymmetries remains an important step for environmental peacebuilding, it is essential to counter narratives that instrumentalize nature to open new alleys for sustainable peace. © 2025, Resilience Alliance.

In this article, we analyze how the implementation of the peace agreement signed in 2016 between the government of Colombia and the FARC-EP guerrilla group affects environment and human rights defenders (EHRD) in Colombia. Despite the expectation of a more peaceful future following the peace agreement, EHRD have faced increased intimidation and violence in Colombia, making it the most dangerous country for EHRD globally. We seek to understand this counter-intuitive development through Fraser’s theory of social justice that stresses the need for integrated measures to address economic, political, and cultural injustices in parallel. The theory argues that a focus on correcting cultural misrecognition and political underrepresentation of vulnerable groups may, paradoxically, mask or even facilitate further injustices, if that focus is not matched by sufficient efforts to address economic maldistribution. The fate of EHRD since the peace agreement reflects such an imbalance in justice priorities, which is in the way of lasting and sustainable peace. Drawing on data from secondary sources, ethnographic interviews, and an analysis of policies and laws, we find that, since the peace agreement was signed, new forms of maldistribution have emerged and solidified in the country, including land grabbing, displacement of local populations, resource extraction, and illicit economies, which are strongly related to the growing influx of drug cartels. Despite the increasing advocacy of international organizations and regional legal agreements to protect EHRD, they are caught in precarious roles between cultural recognition and political and economic abandonment by state institutions and are affected by the global trade in illicit products, and the demand for land for agricultural products and minerals. This finding, we argue, warrants more research into the imbalance of addressing local and global injustices during peace processes and its fatal implications for EHRD in Colombia and globally. © 2025 by the author(s).

Hypothesising the environmental, social, economic and institutional dimensions based upon the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) frame, we employ generalised and ordinary least squares to analyse variables within each dimension that impact on ASPM. Through legal instruments, namely, Right to Petition and Constitutional Right Enforcement, we gathered comprehensive data from mining authorities regarding extraction, formalisation and miner registration across 1122 municipalities throughout the 2010s. Our findings reveal multifaceted associations across dimensions: in environment, whilst illegal gold mining shows a positive causal effect on ASPM, coca cultivation displays varying impacts. In the social dimension, higher multidimensional poverty has a significant positive effect on platinum extraction, while violence exhibits a negative causal bond. In the economic dimension, both infrastructure improvements and rural technological progress have significant negative effects on ASPM activity. In the institutional pillar, higher corruption levels show a positive causal link with extraction, whilst armed illegal groups display divergent effects - FARC-EP rebels relate negatively to production, while paramilitary presence connects positively. These findings underscore that sustainable ASPM requires coordinated interventions: strengthening environmental enforcement, addressing poverty whilst improving security, developing infrastructure and rural technification for formalisation, and implementing anticorruption measures alongside peacebuilding efforts. Indeed, we posit some multi-stakeholder actions towards these ends. This case could enhance both local development and global CRMs supply diversification originating from artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). © 2025","Artisanal and small-scale mining; Critical raw materials; Platinum; Sustainable development goals","Crime; Pillar extraction; Platinum; Platinum mines; Sustainable development goals; Artisanal and small-scale minings; Colombia; Condition; Critical raw materials; Formalisation; Generalized least square; Ordinary least squares; Platinum mining; Small scale; Social-economic; Mine safety; artisanal mining; platinum; small scale mining; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216225986"

However, efforts to characterize this diversity have been hindered by the Colombian armed conflict, which heavily impacted the region. With the signing of peace accords in 2016, improved security has increased agroindustry and human settlements, exacerbating forest fragmentation. This promoted accessibility underscores the urgency of characterizing the composition of the communities in order to subsequently generate conservation policites. As a first step to achieve this goal, our study aimed to identify herpetofauna species in forest fragments in the municipality of Mutatá, Urabá. Here, we report 24 amphibian and 30 reptile species across a sampling effort of 345 person-hours conducted at that site. Despite our efforts, the species accumulation curve indicated that further sampling is necessary to assess species richness more accurately. Urgent environmental action is imperative for conserving Urabá’s herpetofauna, particularly in post-conflict regions experiencing rapid shifts in land use.

The signing of the Peace Accord in 2016 implemented public policies, including tax incentives for companies operating in the Zones Most Affected by the Conflict (ZOMAC). Methodology: The research used a mixed methodology, combining descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. An unsupervised model was used, applying data mining and CRISP-DM methodology to analyse the data. Results: A significant correlation was identified between economic and social variables in the ZOMACs, highlighting the importance of addressing poverty, unemployment and inequality to promote equitable and sustainable development in these regions. The public policies implemented have been key to this process, but their evaluation and adjustment are necessary to maximise their benefits. Discussion: The analysis shows that enterprises in ZOMACs are crucial for economic reactivation, job creation and peacebuilding in areas affected by the armed conflict. Conclusions: The study concludes that it is essential to continue supporting business development in ZOMACs to foster sustainable economic growth, contributing to the stability and well-being of affected communities. © 2025, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

However, Colombia’s demining efforts officially began in 2004, allowing for a 20-year review of the process. Methodology: A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted using open data available on the Geoportal of the Comprehensive Action against Anti-personnel Mines (AICMA) to evaluate progress through December 2023. Results: The analysis indicates an average annual clearance rate of approximately 1,900,000 m². At this rate, it would take at least 20 more years to clear the estimated 52,000,000 m² of contaminated land in Colombia. Discussion: It is noteworthy that, of the 20 years examined, clearance activity was recorded in only 19. This projection does not account for potential increases in mined areas. Conclusions: Colombia’s demining efforts are progressing steadily, but continued commitment and resources are required to meet long-term objectives, given the current clearance rate and the potential for additional contaminated areas. © 2025, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

We introduce the concept of a “peace continuum,” challenging traditional binary approaches to peace and conflict. Our framework highlights how grassroots feminist activists, often excluded from formal peace processes, persist in their peacebuilding efforts even amidst renewed violence, authoritarianism, and failed peace agreements. Drawing on examples from countries such as Colombia, Afghanistan, and Myanmar, the forum showcases how women are leading nonmilitarized, inclusive, and locally grounded peace efforts despite the collapse of formal peace processes. The articles collectively emphasize the resilience, intentionality, and ongoing activism of women in reshaping peace, advocating for gender equality, and addressing structural violence in their societies. The issue calls for broader recognition and support for these crucial, often overlooked, feminist peacebuilding efforts, even in situations deemed “failures.” ©C The Author(s) (2025).

The agricultural sector is crucial for Colombia as it contributes to food security, the economy, and the Nation’s employment rate. However, the agricultural sector is challenged by the environment and its natural resources, especially water in water abstraction and soil in terms of degradation and land cover change. Additionally, climate change exacerbates these challenges by altering precipitation patterns, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and further stressing water and soil resources, making sustainable management even more critical. The Resource Nexus approach comes into play to cope with and mitigate such challenges. Combined with social equity to advance the sustainability of agriculture, the Nexus approach demonstrates pathways towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger)in synergies with other SDGs, like SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). This paper addresses the dual challenge of improving natural resources management and population vulnerability reduction in the frame of environmental conflicts and population inequalities that severely affect the resilience of food systems. In line with principles of inclusion and gender equity, the methodology developed here aims to identify Colombia's productive regions that would benefit from enhanced management at the landscape level, the Resource Nexus approach. With the use of geographic information systems (GIS), this research spatially evaluates the (i) impact of land-use changes and the land-use fragmentation due to resource overuse, (ii) the provision of ecosystem services under different uses of natural resources and suggests ecosystem services planning as a methodology for municipal ecosystem-based management, (iii) climate change and the anthropogenic impacts on agricultural productivity in Colombia at the municipality scale. The results indicate significant environmental changes over the past few decades, including reduced natural forests and increased agricultural land. This shift has coincided with a decrease in freshwater availability. Additionally, there is a concerning trend of agricultural expansion into protected areas, highlighting the ongoing pressures on natural resources and the need for sustainable management practices. This study underscores the value of the science-policy interface to ensure increased social equity, economic growth, and resource conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; Nexus; Post-conflict; Productive landscape management","Agricultural sector; Colombia; Ecosystem services; Landscape management; Nexus; Post-conflict; Productive landscape management; Social equity; Sustainable management; Vulnerability reductions; Fertilizers; boundary dispute; climate change; economic growth; ecosystem service; equity; food production; natural resource; vulnerability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213952485"

To address this analytical gap, this article proposes and applies a new multidimensional framework : the model of victory, which posits that success is a function of five interconnected variables: achievement of political aims, degradation of adversary capabilities, internal and external legitimacy, post-conflict sustainability, and narrative resilience. Applying this model to the prolonged internal war in Colombia as well as the hybrid conflict between India and Pakistan, the analysis demonstrates that shaping the narrative often acts as the central variable, enabling actors to manage the conflict and claim victory, regardless of material outcomes. The article further argues that the centrality of narrative creates new paradoxes for command related to transparency, the use of kinetic force, and the fulfillment of political mandates. The framework ultimately provides a more holistic tool for scholars and practitioners to analyze the complex anatomy of victory in the information age. © 2025 The Author(s).

Yet more than 210 million people currently live under the control of armed non-state actors (ANSAs), many of whom exercise state-like authority over vast, environmentally important territories. Despite growing legal and political science scholarship on ANSAs, their role in environmental protection remains largely unexplored. International law, shaped by conflict-centric frameworks, often fails to account for ANSAs’ non-military dimensions – especially those related to environmental service provision. Similarly, theories of rebel governance have yet to meaningfully incorporate environmental service provision as a governance facet. The article addresses this gap by examining the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC-EP) in Colombia, drawing on documentary analysis and interviews with former combatants. It shifts the limited ecological perspective on war, arguing that the FARC-EP’s environmental practices amounted to a form of rebel environmental governance – structured, intentional and legally plural. Through this case study, the article challenges dominant narratives that view ANSAs solely as environmental spoilers or incidental protectors and instead advocates for a more comprehensive understanding of their impact as environmental service providers and lawmakers. In doing so, the paper reframes ANSAs as socio-legal actors whose environmental practices merit scholarly attention – particularly in ongoing debates around accountability and transitional justice in conflict-affected regions. © The Author(s), 2025.

The legacy of violence has restricted healthcare delivery in these areas, concentrating services in urban centers and exacerbating geographic and social inequities. Informal caregivers in rural communities, essential yet often overlooked actors in healthcare, face significant challenges due to structural limitations and lack of institutional support. Objective: This study evaluates a community-based intervention aimed at strengthening the competencies of informal caregivers in rural, post-conflict settings. It further positions caregivers as pivotal contributors to distributed health education models, where care practices must adapt to contextual barriers and local realities. Methods: Developed using a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, the intervention engaged caregivers as co-creators. Drawing from popular education principles, it combined in-person sessions with experiential, culturally relevant materials tailored to rural environments. Ongoing remote support was provided via calls, text messages, and voice notes. The program was evaluated qualitatively through a focus group and 15 semi-structured interviews, analyzed thematically. Results: Findings revealed four key domains of change: (1) transformation of the caregiving role, (2) personal and technical impact on caregivers, (3) shifts in family dynamics, and (4) recognition of the course as an empowering, community-building experience. Despite barriers such as digital illiteracy, poverty, and low educational attainment, participants demonstrated increased self-efficacy and engagement. Conclusion: The intervention illustrates the potential of distributed education to reduce rural health inequities. It highlights the power of academic-community partnerships in developing scalable, context-sensitive strategies that strengthen care, foster empowerment, and promote equity in underserved areas. © © 2025 Lombo-Caicedo, Durán-Sabogal, Palacio-Abello and Lamus-Lemus.","caregiver empowerment; community engagement; distributive education; participatory educational intervention; popular health education; rural healthcare","adult; aged; Article; care behavior; controlled study; female; health care delivery; health education; home visit; human; human experiment; informal caregiver; male; normal human; participatory action research; qualitative analysis; rural area; semi structured interview; social inequality; wound care","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014512096"

However, these actions have not had an impact on the rural population and the organization of the territory. The objective of this article is to interpret the process of land adjudication during the Peace Process in territories prioritized with Development Programs with a Territorial Approach. A mixed methodology was used, employing techniques such as frequency analysis and multiple correspondence analysis, through the study of the departments of Guaviare, Putumayo and Bolivar. It is evident that the land adjudication process in Colombia within the framework of the Peace Accords is incipient and presents flaws in its execution. However, it should be noted that the target population of agrarian reforms in Colombia are peasants, and this process has benefited excluded population groups such as victims and displaced persons. Achieving structural changes to this problem in Colombia requires institutional commitment and a broader spectrum of time that leads to evidence of the effects of deconcentration of land and social welfare of the rural population in Colombia. © (2025), (Sociedade Brasileira de Economia e Sociologia Rural).

The process of social-ecological restoration is intrinsically linked to the role of local organisations and the support of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which introduce the main technical improvements conditional on the achievement of social improvements. The situation in the South Pacific region of Colombia, a territory historically characterised by illicit crop cultivation and inhabited by vulnerable Afro-Colombian communities, is analysed. This region is particularly significant for post-conflict agreements due to its high level of violence. This study analyses the determinants of differences in the selling price of cacao, assuming that the decision to sell dry cacao and access international markets is related to the support and assistance provided to farmers and their families than to their monetary value. The sustainable production of high-quality dry cacao, which is a main requirement for accessing international market prices, depends on access to adequate infrastructure. Inadequate access to high-quality production neutralises the substitution of illicit crops, and thus the environmental sustainability and social cohesion of the territory. The determinants of farmers’ ability to sell dry cacao are explored using a spatial econometric model that accounts for the influence of neighbouring areas. The findings indicate that enhancing producers' participation in community councils, supported by international NGOs, is crucial for addressing environmental risks. © 2024 The Author(s)","Cacao smallholders; Community organisations; Environmental economics; Equitable price; Illicit crops substitution; Sustainable development","Cleaner production; 'Dry' [; Cacao smallholder; Colombia; Community organizations; Environmental economics; Equitable price; High quality; Illicit crop substitution; International markets; Nongovernmental organizations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211156849"

Here, we applied a highly successful methodology from ecology (Ecological Niche Modelling) to the problem of identifying the ideal socioeconomic conditions for the presence of a Colombian illegal armed group, named the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). We analyzed some determining factors of FARC´s presence and permanence within the Colombian territory that reflect aspects of the socioeconomic dynamics and productive capacity at the municipality level. We found that regions with high suitability for the persistence of the FARC (those belonging to the niche) had a fiscal performance index considered as vulnerable and low per capita income levels. Additionally, to identify territories in dispute between armed groups, we compared territories with the presence of both the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and the FARC. Our results show that the number of municipalities with suitable conditions for the persistence of the FARC was considerably lower following the signing of the Peace Agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC. © 2024 Peace and Conflict Studies.

In the Putumayo region, these wars take their own particular forms. Scientifically, the Putumayo is described as an Andean-Amazonic rainforest. For the indigenous and local inhabitants of the Putumayo, it is the Andean-Amazonic selva. We present three wars on the forest with material and discursive specificities and critically distinguish those that inherently involve violence from the ones that do not. We draw on a mix of empirical material to analyze how the wars on the forest have manifested in the Andean-Amazon. We find that both deforestation and the responses to combat it are two wars on the forest with one thing in common: violence. We also find that the selva is a territorialized political proposal with its own discursive and material elements. Drawing on the concept of territorial peace, we discuss the ambivalence of peacebuilding in relation to violence because it both legitimizes the continuation of violent wars on the forest while providing openings for territorial defense projects. This approach provides analytical avenues to observe the differences between peace and pacification. We contend that violence is incompatible with peace but not with pacification. Further, peace and pacification efforts can coexist under the discursive guise of peacebuilding. We show that peace requires the absence of violence but cannot be defined as the absence of violence alone, for such an understanding cannot distinguish a peaceful context’s territorial relations from those of a pacified context. © 2024 by the author(s).","deforestation; environmental defenders; mining; Putumayo; violence","deforestation; mining; peace process; territorial dispute; violence; Amazonas [Colombia]; Andes; Colombia; Putumayo","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214426819"

Nevertheless, evidence demonstrates that social transformations driven by certain citizen mobilisations do not always prove beneficial to the most marginalised groups. In January 2023, acts of vandalism were perpetrated against the buildings of public institutions in Brasilia. Similarly, anti-democratic mobilisations have been observed in Colombia against the peace agreement with the FARC and in Chile against the proposed more inclusive constitution. Globally, anti-democracy and other movements that are in opposition to human rights are gaining ground, and their effects are having a detrimental impact on the environment in which organisations that are advocating for excluded sectors are operating. However, Latin American perspectives of social and behaviour change (SBC) emphasise engagement with social movements to contribute to social justice, creating alliances to amplify the voices of those most affected without interfering with the organic nature of citizen-led movements. This prompts the following inquiries: Can we categorize as social movements those with popular roots but espousing hegemonic interests? How can the Latin American tradition of social movement action and reflection inform strategies for social change? How can SBC strategies counteract anti-human rights movements and empower social movements prone to inclusion?

The results indicate a process of urban consolidation, with an increase in the mix of uses and high-rise construction, as well as improvements in infrastructure and services. Finally, the limitations related to the scarcity of data and studies in small populated centers and the importance of analyzing this type of urban phenomena in the Colombian post-conflict context are highlighted. © 2024: Author(s).

While many analysis using remote sensing identify land cover change, structural connectivity variables are less studied for understanding landscape transformation. In this work, we used data from the Landsat archive from 2011 to 2021, the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC), and Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to analyze deforestation, land cover change, and landscape connectivity in northwestern Colombia's Amazon. We examined the spatial patterns in three specific subsets in the Colombian arc of deforestation, with a special focus on the surroundings of the National Natural Park Serranía de Chiribiquete. Our results confirm changes in structural connectivity linked to pasture expansion from the conversion forest to pasture during the analyzed period showing changes in the borders of Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park along rivers and roads, where cattle is transported. Before 2016, the average annual deforested area in the three study areas was 27.93 km²; after 2016, this number increased to 73.36 km². The outcomes of our study contribute to an improved understanding of pasture dynamics. They can aid decision-making in areas that play a key role in ecological networks necessary for long-term conservation efforts. Our quantitative assessments have revealed a temporal shrinking of the core area, indicative of a decline in forest cover. Concurrently, we observed an expansion of the edge and background areas, which is consistent with the proliferation of pastures. This study presents methodology and data in support of policy-making for sustainable land use and ecological connectivity to mitigate further environmental degradation in the area. © 2024 The Authors","Cattle ranching; CCDC; Change detection; Colombian Amazon; Deforestation; Land use; Landscape connectivity; MSPA","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199976620"

In this paper, we considered government proposals for expanding payment for ecosystem services (PES) and sustainable silvopastoral systems, and private-sector investment in habitat banking. We coupled the Integrated Economic-Environmental Model (IEEM) with spatially explicit land use and land cover change and ecosystem services models to assess the potential impacts of these programs through the lens of wealth and sustainable economic development. This innovative workflow integrates dynamic endogenous feedbacks between natural capital, ecosystem services and the economic system, and can be applied to other country contexts. Results show that PES and habitat banking programs are strong investment propositions (Net Present Value of US$4.4 and $4.9 billion, respectively), but only when moving beyond conventional economic analysis to include non-market ecosystem services. Where a portfolio investment approach is taken and PES is implemented with sustainable silvopastoral systems, investment returns would reach US$7.1 billion.

Sumapaz, the world's largest paramo, is a crucial water source for over 15 million people in the central Andean region of Colombia. Historically, the paramo functioned as a strategic corridor for the leftist guerrilla Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) to gain access to Bogotá for a potential armed takeover of political power. The specific impact of the conflict between the FARC and the Colombian army in the paramo, as well as the effects of conflict de-escalation, remain understudied. By analyzing forest disturbances and records on victims and conflict events, we identified a unidirectional relationship between the intensity of armed conflict and landscape transformation. Forest disturbances were significantly higher during the armed conflict (2001-2012). In contrast, forest disturbances have markedly decreased since the beginning of peace negotiations in 2012 and the subsequent peace agreement period 2016-2020. These findings contrast with documented trends in other regions of the country, such as the Andean and Amazonian areas. Our results demonstrate that the legacy of armed confrontation between the Colombian army and FARC in the paramo negatively impacted the landscape. Importantly, these findings provide valuable insights into conservation policies and environmental management during the post-peace agreement era, offering an opportunity to develop future preservation actions and shape the future of the Andean Paramo. © 2024 The Authors","Deforestation; Degradation; Highlands; Remote sensing; Warfare ecology","armed forces; community composition; deforestation; degradation; political power; remote sensing; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200992475"

One question of interest is whether policies or interventions conceived to attain desirable goals for the post-conflict society may be effective or, rather, if the constraints imposed by the conflict scenario might produce unintended effects, either on the environmental or the social side. To explore this issue, we envisaged the socio-ecological system as a parsimonious set of characteristic ecological and social variables within the conflict-related framework and reconstructed their interactions, exploiting elicitation-based information and the literature. We visualized the resulting interactive networks as signed digraphs. Applying the qualitative technique of loop analysis combined with numerical simulations, we predicted the response of the system to policies as drivers of change, such as subsidized credit to capital-intensive activities or policies that increase small farming competitiveness and access to markets. Highlighting causal linkages reveals that the persistence of conflict factors may produce unexpected interdependencies between licit and illicit activities and that, only in a few cases, the persistence of these mechanisms allows synergies between desirable goals.

In addition to the usual barriers such as obtaining financing and resources, these individuals deal with stigmatization and deeply rooted hate speech in society, which hinder their reintegration and entrepreneurship after years of conflict and suffering. Methodology: The methodological approach combined in-depth interviews with 10 conflict victims, economic data analysis, and a literature review on entrepreneurship in post-conflict contexts. Participants were strategically selected to represent diverse experiences and geographical areas. Results: The interviews revealed specific barriers such as limited access to financing and resources, lack of business and technical training, and the negative impact of stigmatization and hate speech on their self-confidence as entrepreneurs. Discussions: The study emphasized the urgent need to address these limitations through policies and programs that provide access to financial resources, business training, and psychosocial support specifically oriented towards victims of the internal armed conflict. Conclusions: It is understood that countering hate speech and stigmatization is crucial to creating a more favorable environment for entrepreneurship in communities affected by the conflict. © 2024, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

This research examines the potential drivers of local forest transitions in relation to the peace-building process in Colombia's South Pacific region; an area that has been traditionally dominated by illicit crops, inhabited by vulnerable Afro-Colombian communities and in areas where post-conflict agreements are particularly relevant due to high levels of violence. The study provides valuable insights for public policies that prioritise forest restoration and to assess how this process can contribute to broader goals of sustainable rural development and peace building. The findings highlight the importance of Social and Ecological Restoration (SER) strategies that help local communities to develop medium-term plans, improve decision-making efficiency and create fair and sustainable pathways for rural territories and residents. This study analyses how the introduction of ‘shade-grown’ agroforestry systems (i.e. cacao) to replace illicit crops can be a stepping-stone to regional environmental sustainability and social cohesion by reducing deforestation pressure. The results demonstrate that promoting local economic development and land decentralisation in favour of Afro-Colombian communities may be the key to successfully substituting illicit crops as part of the ongoing peace agreements in Colombia. © 2023","Black communities' heritage; Deforestation processes; Post-conflict strategies; Socio-ecological restoration (SER); Stepping-stones for crop substitution","Conservation; Decision making; Deforestation; Ecology; Regional planning; Restoration; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Black community' heritage; Building process; Colombia; Deforestation process; Ecological restoration; Post-conflict strategy; Socio-ecological; Socio-ecological restoration; Stepping-stone for crop substitution; Stepping-stones; Crops; Decision Making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189753557"

Aquatic ecosystems in the Andes-Amazon transition zone of Colombia are now at high risk due to expanded human activities after peace agreements in 2016 ended armed conflict because lands formerly controlled by FARC and other armed groups are now prone to agricultural and urban expansion. Particularly, expanding human land use may reduce fish diversity across the altitudinal gradient, especially in the premontane streams (i.e., <500 m a.s.l.) because lands are more amenable to human use than at greater altitudes. We evaluated fish α-diversity (measured as species richness, total abundance, and effective species number) and β-diversity (spatial and temporal) in 12 sites over 8 years bracketing the end of armed conflict. All α-diversity and β-diversity analyses were evaluated relative to categorical altitude (< or >500 m) and continuous altitude. Strong differences in fish community structure among sites occurred as a function of altitude. Fish communities exhibit altitudinal biodiversity gradients that are consistent in space and time, and that need to be accounted for conservation and management considerations. Our results provide a reference to identify short- and long-term changes due to impending human land use at a critical moment for the conservation of tropical fish diversity. Similar studies in other areas of the upper Amazon Basin are needed to evaluate effects of subsequent human activities on diversity patterns and our study area to compare to reference conditions reported here. © 2024 The Authors.

Structural conflict conditions of the conflict are often emphasized as key explana- tory variables. However, this approach often neglects the actual intricacies of peace talks once they are in place and, instead, correlates negotiation outcomes with variables that are not actively part of them. Drawing on con- flict resolution theory and the theory of complexity, the article proposes a theory for understanding the dynamics of peace negotiations. The main argument is that in a complex environment like one of peace talks, deci- sions on process design can be a key determinant of the effort devoted by the parties, and thus, of the negotiations unfolding. One contribution of this approach is the recognition of the potential of a negotiation to trans- form the relationship between the parties from one of conflict to one of cooperation in a joint effort to work toward a negotiated solution, pro- vided that the complexity of the negotiation and the uncertainties associ- ated to it are properly managed. Negotiation process design can provide some of the tools to do so. Similarly, this approach makes it possible to understand the existence of negotiations in which the parties are inter- ested in keeping the dialogue open, regardless of some conditions of the conflict, for instance, alleged lack of ripeness. As an example, the paper studies the case of the Colombian government's parallel peace negotia- tions with the FARC and the ELN in the period 2010-2018, which shows the possible role of process design variables in the different paths of these two negotiations. © The Author(s) (2024).","","conflict management; negotiation process; peace process; Colombia","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184579678"

Previous disarmament events indicated potential shifts in violence and recidivism rates among ex-combatants. This paper aims to determine the likelihood that, in the post-conflict era with FARC, these ex-combatants would rearm themselves into new criminal factions. Employing a methodology by Paul Collier, the study utilized logit, probit, and panel data models with both fixed and random effects to evaluate the recidivism risk at the municipal level. A 1% increase in per capita municipal income decreased conflict probability due to the increased opportunity cost of disrupting economic endeavors. Conversely, 1% increases in potential conflict benefits from tax revenue and natural resource proceeds raised the probability of conflict by 40% and 17%, respectively.

As a result, it was possible to enter lands which had been inaccessible and untouched by human development during the war and the potential to exploit these for ecotourism became apparent. The aim of this study was to see how, through sensitively interviewing 12 actors in the field of Colombian ecotourism, Colombia could use this form of tourism to its advantage in a meaningful way, preserving the phenomenal diversity of the country’s nature and cultures, and moving towards a peaceful resolution of the war. The interviewees’ pride for Colombia’s natural and cultural treasures was evident as they expressed a clear desire to see ecotourism boom while respecting these assets. The picture the participants painted is a nuanced one with the unrivalled ecotourism potential of the country balanced against many challenges including a population uneducated in hospitality and a perceived lack of infrastructure and strategy. Several recommendations are made including marketing, preferably digitally, to specific niches, educating locals, improving national security and infrastructure and creating a solid strategy for ecotourism so that the Colombian population may finally benefit from its virgin lands. © 2024 WIT Press.","Colombia; community empowerment; ecotourism; environmental conservation; peacebuilding; post-conflict; reconciliation; social cohesion; tourism development","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218890758"

As a rare, longitudinal study on restoring the rule of law in the midst of conflict and instability that has engendered successful outcomes, Colombia’s constitutional reform of 1991 deserves to be studied for its lessons on the interrelationships among security, peace processes, human rights, and legal and institutional reform, to include the role of the judiciary. Toward that end, this case study merges comparative constitutional theory with the constituent process to illustrate how constitution-making can be used as a platform for compromise in deeply divided societies in a way that advances democratic transition while setting future conditions for peace. Taken together, the insights illuminated by the Colombian experience represent a variation on incrementalist approaches that have been advocated in the context of democratic development in other contested environments and affirm the importance of judicial independence to ensuring the legitimacy of both process and outcomes. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Nauman Reayat, Rhona K.

The Commission's approach provides elements for advancing the consolidation of an eco-legal turn in transitional justice, allowing for the challenge of some of the anthropocentric tendencies that have traditionally characterized it. The report recognizes the decisive role that non-human nature played in the development of the armed conflict, reclaiming its victim status, and highlights the importance of repairing the damaged socioecosystemic ties as a necessary condition for achieving a stable peace. The Colombian case demonstrates the need to consider the complex human-nonhuman relationships in the explanation and resolution of social conflicts, as well as in the construction of a truly equitable society. Although the ecocentric approach of the Report represents a significant advancement in the field of transitional justice, the article suggests that the Truth Commission fails to draw all the consequences of its own approach from the perspective of environmental restorative justice. © 2024 Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana.

The purpose of this article is to identify and analyze the patterns, groupings, and key factors that have shaped the current reality of these ventures, highlighting how historical and environmental dynamics have influenced their development. The research was conducted in three phases: identification of ecotourism ventures, evaluation of owners' perceptions regarding economic, sociocultural, and environmental aspects, and statistical analysis of the collected data. The case study of Florencia, Caquetá, highlights the positive influence of ecotourism on employment, income, and cultural valuation. The research identified three distinct groups of ecotourism ventures: the first, with high participation in cultural activities and a positive perception of ecotourism in terms of employment and community well-being; the second, composed of individuals with university education and experience in livestock farming; and the third, closely linked to the Hacha River and focused on the conservation of water resources. Ecotourism in Florencia, if properly managed, has the potential to be a powerful tool for peace and sustainability in the Colombian Amazon. Integrating environmental history into the planning and management of ecotourism is crucial for developing innovative approaches and inclusive policies that promote reconciliation and equitable development. Personalizing tourism development strategies, strengthening local capacities, and recognizing indigenous knowledge are essential to maximizing the benefits of ecotourism and contributing to the conservation of the Amazon ecosystem. © 2024 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

However, tourism at these high altitudes has emerged as a choice for local development that rebuilds mountain people’s and ex-combatants’ lives. This study uses a mini case study of a tourism cooperative formed by victims of the Colombian Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) guerrilla and former combatants that operates in mountainous highlands and uses dark tourism to create economic, environmental and social opportunities for mountain dwellers. The main tourist attractions are the exotic biodiversity and stays in recreated guerrilla jungle camps with no portable water, bathrooms, energy, or access roads. This chapter is one of the first attempts to shed new light on dark tourism as a way to reintegrate ex-combatants of FARC and victims of the Colombian armed conflict as an alternative for mountain dwellers in a post-conflict developing country. The applications of this case study are to show how tourism can be used as a tool for reintegration of ex-combatants and victims of armed conflicts in mountainous regions.

The case of Minca is an example of a rural area affected by armed conflict and violence, which has undergone a shift from legal and illegal agricultural activities, including the cultivation of coca, to nature-based tourism that accelerated after the signing of a peace agreement with FARC in 2016. The case study shows that communities face many difficulties in achieving sustainable development and the consolidation of peace.. This chapter discusses the role of governance and social capital in building resilience to accelerated tourism development in the post-conflict context. The key problems associated with low resilience are limited governance capacity and asymmetric power relations between the community and external stakeholders. Strong community and multilevel governance, and social capital are required to build community-wide resilience to mitigate negative impacts, avoid conflicts, and create collaboration among stakeholders. In Minca, however, local and national governments failed to provide a favorable legal environment and an institutional structure granting community control over the scale, speed, and nature of development and its negative impacts. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Rami K.

To accomplish this task, an exploration of the context was conducted, including the general characteristics of the territory that contributed to the emergence of the conflict, the environmental damages caused during the war, and the main actors involved in the degradation of the territory, based on the perceptions, opinions, experiences, and feelings of former combatants. Information was collected through in-depth interviews. The results focused on understanding the significant elements of the link between the environmental situation and the post-peace agreement period.

Existing research emphasizes the necessity of implementing limited-duration cantonments to mitigate potential security dilemmas. The 2016 Peace Agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP) provides a unique experience, deviating from conventional practices by maintaining cantonments over an extended period, with some evolving into permanent settlements. What are the effects of this strategy on community-based reintegration? Drawing upon original data from interviews, ethnographic observation, and surveys conducted in conflict-affected communities, this paper compares two cases: a cantonment successfully transformed into a permanent settlement and another initially promising cantonment that ultimately failed to achieve permanence. This study argues that long-term cantonments contribute to community-based reintegration benefiting former combatants and receiving communities by maintaining internal cohesion, supporting the local economy, and rebuilding the social fabric in conflict-affected territories. However, specific conditions, particularly land ownership and security, are crucial for such a development. Without these conditions, long-term cantonments face the risk of being closed or relocated, threatening peacebuilding outcomes. The displacement of ex-combatants to other territories hinders community access to the benefits offered by the collective reintegration process. © 2024 The Author(s).

Building upon ethnographic works conducted in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta region in the Caribbean coast and the department of Guaviare in the eastern lowlands, this chapter discusses some of the contemporary political dilemmas of campesinos in Colombia. It analyzes the institutional, sociopolitical, and economic entanglements through which the state portrays campesinos as allies in the transformation of uncivilized spaces (e.g., forests and mountains) in some cases, and as predators of strategic resources and environments in others. In the context of a post-peace agreement between the government and the guerrillas, the chapter reflects on the ways in which campesinos are stigmatized and criminalized and provides a counter narrative of the everyday tensions and networks of environmental care through which they endure and protect their livelihoods and lives. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198299212"

Mental health services in Colombia are fragmented, inadequate, and difficult to access for many. Young people’s help-seeking is often hindered by mental health stigma and/or poor experiences with services. This paper presents a thematic analysis of qualitative data from a mixed-methods study aimed at developing and testing a mental health intervention for Colombian youths.

By illustrating how study participants talked about stigma, vulnerability, mental health services organisation, and the challenges of discussing mental health topics in a learning environment, we illuminate aspects of mental health support and anti-stigma interventions that might need enhancing. In particular, we suggest that more emphasis on ‘community competencies’ as complementary to and interrelated with individual competencies would strengthen young people’s individual and collective resources for mental wellbeing while being in line with the sociocritical principles of existing human capital-enhancing programmes. © 2024 The Author(s).

While much of the analyses of deforestation in the Amazon have been in Brazil, there is a need to extend to Colombia where forest and land use exploitation are driven by post-conflict social and political dynamics. This research contributes to this knowledge gap by unpacking the mechanisms underpinning deforestation on the northwestern side of the Colombian Amazon. We used theory-building process-tracing to guide us in conceptualizing the underlying logics of deforestation in the region through qualitative text analysis of policy documents, articles, reports, and grey literature, and virtual semi-structured interviews with key national, regional and local actors. Findings indicate that the power vacuum resulting from the demobilization of FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), Marxist-Leninist guerrillas, acted as a window of opportunity for peasants, squatters, narco-traffickers, cattle ranchers, landlords, and other investors to access public lands and capitalize from converting forests to coca crops and pastures for cattle ranching. Accumulation of land and surplus primarily from cattle ranching and coca production has increased the ability of these actors to reshape the landscape and societal structures. Traditional elites and old and emerging narco-bourgeoisie have capitalized on preexisting power asymmetries by disproportionally accumulating land, money, gun power, influence, and prestige seeking to consolidate territorial hegemony, and controlling the means for material reproduction in society. Powerful actors use their resources and prestige to displace historically marginalized groups – such as indigenous communities, peasants and squatters – from their means of subsistence and production, resulting in the installation of a capitalist economy based on land rent and drug trafficking, where less powerful and marginalized actors engage in deforestation as means for capital accumulation and subsidizing their peasant and subsistence economies. All this has deepened forest loss, inequalities, and conflict over land access between actors. © (2024), (University of Arizona Libraries).

Methodology: A thorough review of the literature on the history of the occupation of the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon territories was conducted, as well as of reports, statements, news articles, and other related documents. Results: It was concluded that, in the Brazilian case, there was an intentional dismantling of the Amazon's protection policies. In Colombia, the demobilization of the FARC represented a green light for the expansion of the forest clearing process. The spread and overlap of various environmental crimes committed by criminal organizations in the region were observed, notably the illegal extraction of wood, minerals, and fish, associated with the strengthening of drug trafficking and the increase in the number of people murdered. Originality and relevance: This is the first study that establishes political comparisons between the causes of the increase in deforestation and other associated environmental crimes in Brazil and Colombia.

We propose two sequential mechanisms through which previous land dispossession resulted in the emergence of rebel-armed groups. First, the ideological cohesion stemming from radical liberals and communists exacerbated the grievances and helped to shape the political objectives of the rebel armed groups. Once revolutionary ideology had spread in the rural areas, the exposure to violent events that gave military training, access to weapons, and military experience to the rural population, ended up facilitating the formation of rebel groups. Using a matching-pair instrumental variable approach and a novel municipal-level data set, the study documents that municipalities experiencing floods between 1914 and 1946 were more likely to experience land dispossession than municipalities that did not. Floods temporarily worsened the conditions of the land and its value, facilitating the dispossession of peasant land by large landowners and the rise of grievances. © 2023 The Author(s)","Civil conflict; Land conflict; Land reform; Property rights; Weather shocks","agricultural land; civil society; historical geography; ideology; land reform; military intervention; property rights; rural society; social conflict; social movement; violence; weather; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171570612"

The rapid loss of tropical rainforests is threatening the integrity of protected areas and connectivity in the Amazon and other natural regions. In the context of the post-conflict stage, a set of land use and land cover change scenarios were constructed for the Colombian Amazon for the year 2040, using expert coherent narratives. Three scenarios were designed: trend, extractivist, and sustainable development. Historic land use change and driving factors were analyzed throughout 14 transitions between the years 2002 and 2016, based on the interpretation of Landsat images and their relationship with 29 driving factors using artificial neural networks. The Markov chain model was calculated for the transitions, and the change allocation model was parameterized to spatially simulate the scenarios. The results showed that the LULC model calibration and validation were satisfactory (0.91). The sustainable development scenario that considers strong policies for the conservation of forests and implementation of sustainable production projects was the option with greater values for conserved forests and secondary vegetation in recovery, adding ~ 42 million hectares by 2040. The other scenarios showed that the Colombian Amazon will lose ~ 2 million hectares of forests in the trend scenario and ~ 4.3 million hectares in the extractivist scenario, based on the reference year (2016). In the trend scenario, pastures and crops could increase by 48%; and, in the extractivist scenario, these would increase by 117%, changing from ~ 3.9 to ~ 8.6 million hectares. We hope that the scientific contribution of this study will be relevant for informed discussion in decision-making and provide a framework for building a peaceful territory. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; artificial neural network; calibration; crop; decision making; forest; land use; Markov chain; nonhuman; pasture; satellite imagery; sustainable development; vegetation; agriculture; Colombia; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; rain forest; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Rainforest; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147567717"

The underlying causes of these land activities include historical processes of colonization, armed conflict, and narco-trafficking. We aim to examine how illicit cattle ranching and coca farming are driving forest cover change over the last 34 years (1985–2019). To achieve this aim, we combine two pixel-based approaches to differentiate between coca farming and cattle ranching using hypothetical observed patterns of illicit activities and a deep learning algorithm. We found evidence that cattle ranching, not coca, is the main driver of forest loss outside the legal agricultural frontier. There is evidence of a recent, explosive conversion of forests to cattle ranching outside the agricultural frontier and within protected areas since the negotiation phase of the peace agreement. In contrast, coca is remarkably persistent, suggesting that crop substitution programs have been ineffective at stopping the expansion of coca farming deeper into protected areas. Countering common narratives, we found very little evidence that coca farming precedes cattle ranching. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the expansion of illicit land uses reflect the cumulative outcome of agrarian policies, Colombia’s War on Drugs, and the 2016 peace accord. Our study enables the differentiation of illicit land activities, which can be transferred to other regions where these activities have been documented but poorly distinguished spatiotemporally. We provide an applied framework that could be used elsewhere to disentangle other illicit land uses, track their causes, and develop management options for forested land systems and people who depend on them. © 2023, The Author(s).","","cocaine; agricultural land; agriculture; animal; bovine; coca; Colombia; environmental protection; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Coca; Cocaine; Conservation of Natural Resources; Farms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147412301"

Its public management of crops for illicit use has swung between eradication, substitution, and, recently legalization. Forced eradication has been shown to be ineffective, and legalization is an incipient option, so the Peace Agreement puts forward substitution as the path to follow. Yet, what kind of substitution does it suggest? This article analyzes voluntary substitution projects in Peasant Reserve Zones. While some projects have evolved locally due in part to strong peasant associations, they have not gained traction nationally. In general, the difficulties inherent in any business play a role, but there are also structural limitations such as continued fumigations, obligations of prior eradication, the costs of production and transportation due to the lack of infrastructure and public services, and the issue of land rights, which limits peasants' access to the formal funding established by the Peace Agreement. © 2023 The Authors.

The mountainous Andean páramos ecosystem and paramuno/paramero campesinos of Boyacá have found themselves at the centre of some of these challenges. The páramos and their people – predominantly socio-economically precarious campesino farmers – are facing conservation policies to delimit, protect and control their livelihoods. Using a combination of qualitative methods, including interviews and participant-observation, to foreground campesinos' experiences, this paper explores the socio-environmental tensions emerging amidst this context of conservation. This paper argues that the delimitation process is constitutive of neoliberal conservation, which prioritises land sparing, ecosystem service payments and other ‘green business’. Furthermore, the delimitation process does not address the structural factors driving environmental degradation in the páramos, which is linked to an agro-extractivist model. Over recent decades, campesinos have been driven into increasingly agro-extractivist farming which encourages specialisation, monocropping, intensification, and dependence on external inputs. Spatially this has pushed them up to expand the agricultural frontier, as well as pushed them down within and out of the páramos and farming livelihoods. Now additionally squeezed by conservation restrictions, the delimitation is exacerbating historic inequality and mistrust. As a mountainous, small-scale farming case-study, in a conflict setting, this is a novel and unique addition to agro-extractivism research. Analysing the delimitation process through neoliberal conservation and agro-extractivism provides a systemic approach, which highlights the inconsistencies and contradictions of the policies promoted in the páramos. The paper thus demonstrates how the neoliberal conservation agenda is not only compatible with but integral to the agro-extractivist landscape, as it compensates for environmental spill-overs without questioning the prevailing market model. Rather than seek more socio-ecologically just farming practices, it opens new frontiers for capital and compromises socio-environmental peace. © 2023 The Authors","Agro-extractivism; Campesino farming; Extractivism; Livelihoods; Neoliberal conservation; Socio-environmental tensions","conservation; conservation management; environmental degradation; livelihood; neoliberalism; peace process; peacekeeping; Boyaca; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166514155"

We explore how post-conflict programmes, plans and policies shape the uneven distribution of life and death, focussing in particular on the elimination of indigenous leaders. Drawing on research conducted in northern Cauca, Colombia, where many indigenous leaders have been threatened and murdered despite the signing of the Peace Agreement in 2016, our analysis reveals four key factors: 1) The coloniality of power that treats their bodies as disposable and not fully human; 2) The juxtaposition of illicit economies and neoliberal extractivist enterprises in their territories; 3) Violent opposition to their autonomous political projects that aim to defend their land and forms of being; and 4) The disputed presence of peacebuilding programmes seeking to substitute illicit crops. Analysing the relationship between necropolitics, racism and spatial segregation is shown to be crucial to understanding the violence faced by indigenous leaders and communities in post-conflict situations.

The diversity of fish species and characteristics of the aquatic environments (creeks, streams, and river channels) in which they live were determined by means of the Bio Anorí expedition. During the expedition, we evidenced the presence of alluvial mining activity, and we contrasted the environmental characteristics of the sites without disturbances with those where there was mining activity. A total of 478 specimens were captured, representing 22 endemic species of the region. The dominant species (Brycon henni, Chaetostoma aff. brevilabiatum, Creagrutus affinis) were distributed in the three environments, while the less abundant species (e.g., Leptoancistrus or Characidium) were captured in a particular environment. The number of species captured in each aquatic environment was representative and adjusted to the values expected to be obtained. Stream environments harbored a higher diversity of fish. A representative species inventory was inferred; however, this analysis suggested that it is possible to capture more species in the aquatic environments evaluated. The composition of assemblages was similar among aquatic environments; although, differences were observed between creeks and rivers. Stream environments connected creeks and river assemblages. In terms of environmental characteristics, the evaluated streams and creeks were cold, more transparent, and highly oxygenated; the opposite occurred in the rivers, which were less oxygenated, more turbid, and warmer. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that species composition was influenced by the physicochemical conditions of the water. This study provides information associated with fish distribution in a region of the Colombian Andes that was under an armed conflict for more than five decades. In addition, it allowed us to observe habitat transformations because of alluvial mining activity. Finally, it is essential to continue exploring remote areas to know their preservation status and apply conservation measures. © 2023 The Authors","Conservation; Diversity; Environmental conditions; Gold mining; Magdalena basin; Neotropical fish","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151377068"

Public trust in the legitimacy of a peace agreement is a critical component of rebuilding the economic and social foundations of a war-torn nation. Objectives: We argue that the levels of trust of former combatants and confidence in their effective demobilization depend on two critical features of the postconflict environment: fears of insecurity and community engagement. Method: We focus our analysis on Colombia and utilize data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project to create a multivariate time-series analysis of public trust in two groups—leftist rebels and rightist paramilitaries. Results: We find that both the fear of former combatants and the level of engagement individuals have in their communities help predict respondent attitudes about trust in former combatants and reintegration. Conclusion: Fear and familiarity are key determinants in reintegration of former combatants. © 2023 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","Colombia; former combatant; public; reintegration; survey research; trust","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149268406"

EPB literature has been shaped predominantly by political science perspectives, initially with a focus on interstate conflicts, and ecological dynamics have received little attention to date. Building on the Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF), we develop a framework for community-based EPB and test it in post-conflict settings in the department of Cesar, Colombia. We use a qualitative mixed-methods approach, with 26 semi-structured interviews, six focus group discussions, and a World Café session with 30 participants. Our findings show that in six cases communities self-organize to access, conserve, and defend water and land resources while striving to achieve recognition of their civic rights by state actors. A central outcome of cooperation within and among communities is the (re)construction of collective and territorial identities and increased social cohesion. However, community-based EPB does not contribute to improving relations between communities and the private sector or the state, thus failing to strengthen actor relationships that are essential for Colombian peacebuilding. Despite limitations of this exploratory analysis, our approach proves fruitful for integrating ecological aspects in the understanding of EPB. To further develop the EPB concept, future research should look to other disciplines to diversify the understanding of key terms like resource value, cooperation, and peace. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cesar; Colombia; Community-based natural resource management; Conflict; Cooperation; Environmental peacebuilding; Framework; Social-ecological systems","conceptual framework; environmental management; local participation; natural resource; peacekeeping; resource management; Cesar; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152671572"

Current landscapes reflect an ongoing local transition from organic-based agriculture to an industrial one that began in the first half of the 20th century. This transition has happened within a complex sociopolitical and cultural context in which the rural livelihoods are at a crossroads with regional agroindustry development. We propose an integrated landscape-metabolism assessment based on georeferenced farm system typologies (local scale) and the region's land cover data (landscape scale). The results expose the rupture between society (sociometabolic flows) and nature (ecological processes) in this metropolitan region driven by land-use intensification. Our findings support the hypothesis of the contribution of biocultural landscapes to the region's ecological functioning, and that show that agroforestry mosaics can offer promising contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision in metropolitan regions.This landscape-metabolism assessment offers an opportunity to enrich intersectoral land policy formulation for highly biological and culturally diverse regions where agriculture constitutes a fundamental pillar to its economy, the local culture, and rural livelihoods.

What do these practices consist of, what elements underlie them, and what implications do they have for the exercise of citizenship? Through interviews, timeline mapping workshops, and a review of different secondary sources, I argue that these practices contribute to the survival of a community that is anchored to its physical territory. These practices are critical if the community is to be included in the project of modern Colombia, that is, adapting to the changes brought by a new constitution in the 1990s and later to the project of post-conflict as a result of the peace dialogues between the state and the FARC-EP guerrilla between 2012 and 2016. Instead of policies of differentiation, Villa Gloria demands inclusion. To validate these arguments, I critique linear time and analyse three practices: the defence of territory, the search for recognition as ethnic people and as victims of the armed conflict, and peaceful resistance. These analyses provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the exercise of human rights by Black people on the margins of the nation-state. © 2023 Australian Human Rights Institute.","Black communities; Cartagena de Indias; critical geography; land struggles; qualitative methods; Time","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184226255"

Such is the case with the systems proposed in the Nueva Colombia (New Colombia) farm, located in the Pondores area of the Fonseca municipality in La Guajira, Colombia. In order to answer the question “Are the production systems of the Nueva Colombia farm sustainable?”, we carried out a qualitative agroecological assessment of five systems used (maize [Zea mays L.], cassava [Manihot esculenta Cranta], plantain [Musa x paradisiaca L. var. Hartón], cattle ranching, and poultry farming). Producers, technical consultants, and researchers participated in the assessment, with the goal of establishing a viability baseline and criteria to determine the convenience of allocating resources for the continuity of the systems. The results show that the Nueva Colombia farm is located in a very dry tropical forest life zone. The assessment shows moderate sustainability for plantain and cassava crops and weak sustainability for maize. As for the animal production systems, it was found that cattle ranching is not a sustainable system and that, therefore, its operation is not viable, while poultry farming is moderately sustainable. We concluded that it is not advisable to continue cattle production, and that the resources should be reallocated towards improving the poultry farming system. The agricultural systems require the implementation of practices that increase the specific and spatial diversity of crops, as well as their stress tolerance and the proportion of organic matter in soil. © (2023), (Colegio de Postgraduados).

The cultivation of coffee has acquired a very important role in the post-conflict stage that Colombia is experiencing. The rural areas hit hardest by violence are now seeing how improving agricultural conditions can help promote sustainable development and build peace in their regions. In coffee processing, women play an important role, with between 20% and 30% of coffee farms around the world being female-operated and up to 70% of labor in coffee production being provided by women. Women not only contribute to coffee processing, but they are also responsible for family activities such as cooking, and those activities are often made in wood stoves, thereby increasing their health risk. Against this background, this study presents the design and implementation of a biodigester fed by waste produced at Coffee Production Units (CPUs) located in the rural area of Tolima department in Colombia (an important scene of the armed conflict) in order to produce biogas for domestic cooking activities. Results show that implemented biodigester can produce between 1362 and 1597 kg/day (1.1704 and 1.3604 Nm3/day), which is enough energy for domestic activities for a family of four. Furthermore, it demonstrates benefits in the economic, social and environmental context of CPUs. Additionally, due to the importance of women in coffee production, this paper also evaluates the impact of the implementation of biodigesters in farms, which has shown that biodigester implementation positively impacts the production activities and activities performed by women, thereby increasing their life quality. © 2023 by the authors.","coffee-growing women; post-conflict; renewable energy; sustainable development","alternative energy; biogas; coffee; cultivation; economic impact; energy efficiency; environmental impact; sustainable development; womens employment; womens health; womens status; Colombia; Tolima","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176781945"

The contributors to the special issue use a variety of methods and interdisciplinary approaches to study questions regarding land tenure and forced displacement during conflict, the assassination of social leaders in post-conflict scenarios, as well as dataset comparability and accuracy in micro-level analyses. They tackle the challenges of micro-level studies of conflict, namely the disconnect between the macro- and the micro-levels, data quality, and generalization. Indeed, although all articles use Colombia in their empirical analyses, the theoretical contributions are broad and general: land tenure structures cause and are caused by conflict dynamics; national policies will be met with violence to preserve local orders; and relatively rich data environments are not as reliable as they might seem.

In this study, we identified opportunities where forest restoration and rehabilitation programs in Colombia also align with priority areas for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds. We used citizen science eBird-based abundance estimates to define regions with the highest richness of Neotropical migratory birds of conservation concern at montane elevations in Colombia and aligned these high richness areas with domestic initiatives for forest protection (Forest Areas), restoration (Restoration Areas) and rehabilitation (Rehabilitation Areas). We quantified the location and amounts of these three areas as well as the type of land protection and designation within them, specifically, National Protected Areas, Indigenous Reserves, Afro-descendent territories, and regions affected by poverty and violence that are prioritized for rural development by the Colombian government in Post-conflict Territorially Focused Development Programs (PDET). Almost half of Forest Areas overlapped with PDETs where goals for economic development present a risk of forest loss if not done sustainably. There was a 20% overlap between Forest Areas and Afro-descendant territories and indigenous reserves; most of this overlap was outside of established protected areas thus presenting an opportunity for community forest conservation that benefits migratory birds. We found an alignment of less than 6% between migrant bird focal areas and the priority Restoration and Rehabilitation Areas identified by the Colombian National Restoration Plan indicating less opportunity for these programs to simultaneously benefit Neotropical migrant species. Our approach highlights that timely and efficient conservation of declining migrants depends on identifying the regions and strategies that incorporate local communities as part of the solution to forest loss and degradation in Colombia. © 2023 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Conservation; eBird; Neotropical migrants; Non-breeding season; Working landscapes","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149678038"

Within this context, the place that agroecology has begun to occupy as an important element of the different repertoires of popular mobilization deserves to be analyzed. Objective: To analyze the nature of the relationship between peasant mobilizations and agroecology in a critical period in the country's history in which rural communities have had to face the economic, environmental and political crisis generated by the agrarian development model. that is imposed within a context of violence to help understand the possibilities that agroecology brings with it in the construction of technical, economic, political and cultural alternatives to the dominant political regime in Colombia. Hypothesis: Agroecology is rooted in the environmental, economic and sociocultural logic of traditional Colombian communities, where it reappears today as a practice and a living discourse to maintain and strengthen their historical ways of life. Methodology: the study is based on primary, spatial, quantitative and qualitative information that allows identifying the place that the country's peasants have given to agroecology within their discourses in the search for a dignified life, and therefore for a decent agriculture. and a fairer society. Results: The incipient formation of a social mobilization in favor of agroecology in Colombia that, in coordination with other actors from the academy, NGOs, and even State institutions, is configured with the purpose of transforming the historical obstacles for the positioning of agroecology in the different territories. Implications: The approaches of agroecology offer peasant organizations an ideological and discursive platform that maintains identity with the different types of struggles that peasants must undertake in defense of their territories. Conclusions: There is an unprecedented and diverse social process in Colombia in which agroecology begins to position itself on the public agenda hand in hand with a series of public policy proposals that are built through the various peasant mobilizations. © © the authors.

Its signing has provided an opportunity for LGBTI organizations to advocate for an inclusive and affirmative peace that furthers the recognition of their rights. As part of the territorial implementation and the strengthening of local political participation, the agreement reformed the Local Councils for Peace, Reconciliation and Social Cohesion (CTPRC). In this article, we employ interviews and document analysis to explore the local experiences of LGBTI people’s participation in the territorial implementation of the agreement and the CTPRCs. It also reflects on the impact of their participation in promoting the recognition of their human rights and equal participation. These actions are framed in what contemporary currents of peace studies have called critical peace or post-liberal peace. The article argues that the CTPRCs, as spaces for territorial participation in the agreement, have provided an explicit arena for LGBTI people and organizations, but this participation has yet to be translated into the strengthening of their human rights, in building a heterogeneous territorial peace, and in ensuring safe, stigmatization-free environments. © 2023, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

A major component of SSR is the re-training and re-education of local police to improve their relationship with the local communities. This relationship has often been severely strained by human rights abuses committed by police against community members during the conflict, and it continues to be put to the test in fragile post-accord environments by persisting high levels of violence. However, research on how to improve that relationship, particularly from a bottom-up perspective, remains scarce. This study analyses the dynamics of the relationship between the police and communities in the transition period from war to peace in Colombia, a country tormented by continued violence even after the signing of the 2016 peace agreement that was to set an end to the country’s decades of internal conflict. Based on semi-structured interviews conducted during the fall of 2019, it applies the theoretical lens of the relational peace framework that approaches peace in terms of relationships between different sets of interdependent actors. The findings indicate that the relationship between the communities and the police has not reached satisfactory levels of relational peace, suggesting a set-back in security-related peacebuilding. The paper concludes with recommendations, including from interviewees, on how to improve that relationship. © 2022 The Author(s).

This situation modifies the use intensity of natural resources in these areas. Particularly, zones with anti-personnel mines seem to be reservoirs of biodiversity because the conflict causes these areas to be abandoned and excluded from extractive activities. Colombia has endured five decades of armed conflict, which prompted farmers to abandon rural areas and, in some cases, reduced the exploitation of natural resources in those regions, favouring the conservation of native forests. In this study, we aimed to determine the indirect effects of the armed conflict on the tree diversity of Selva de Florencia National Natural Park, Central Andes, Colombia. We established vegetation transects in areas that, during the armed conflict, had anti-personnel mines (mined zone) and areas free of anti-personnel mines (non-mined zone) within the park. We determined that species richness, composition and structure differed between mined and non-mined zones. We found larger tree sizes and more timber trees in the mined zone compared to the non-mined zone. Our results suggest that anti-personnel mines create inaccessible zones within the park, where activities such as selective logging ceased for almost two decades.

We argue that unflattening the local in research on peace and conflict has the potential to explain why multi-modal participatory peacebuilding produces tensions, disappointments, and adaptations across a volatile and fluid state-society interface. Our analysis focuses on three space-relational dimensions: contested claims to territorial representation; the scalar organisation of the state; and the dynamics of extensive uneven urbanisation in peripheral regions. Catatumbo, a conflict-affected borderland region of Colombia, constitutes the empirical focus of our study, which covers both the protracted negotiations leading to the 2016 national peace agreement and its ongoing fraught implementation. Drawing on mixed-methods research, our findings show that despite vibrant forms of pro-peace participation, a regional consensus failed to emerge amidst ongoing violence, unfulfilled state promises and new threats to the economy and environment. Yet, grassroots peacebuilding continues to be reinvented and includes innovative forms of socio-territorial dialogue. Concluding remarks reflect on opportunities to broaden space-relational analysis of socially and geographically complex peacebuilding efforts across and beyond Colombia. © 2022 The Authors","","border region; peace process; peacekeeping; peripheral region; political conflict; territoriality; urbanization; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135316771"

The objective of the research was to characterize the productive system of Sacha Inchi in the municipality of Arauquita, Colombia. Fifty farmers were selected (40 peasants and 10 ex-combatants of the FARC-EP), using an intentional non-probabilistic sampling. The information was collected through a questionnaire and two participatory workshops aimed at identifying limitations and potentialities of the agroecological and productive system. Data were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate statistics. The classification analysis allowed partitioning the set of farmers, based on socioeconomic and environmental characteristics necessary to guide extension plans. The results showed that the most used agroecological practices are: soil conservation, application of lime, use of compost as fertilizer, use of certified seed and direct sowing. Low crop rotation and limited use of phytosanitary products were evidenced. The participatory workshops made it possible to identify crop limitations such as low productivity, few marketing channels and lack of knowledge of some agroecological techniques necessary to improve its productivity. Agroecological practices must be reinforced and expanded through extension programs to achieve recognition as agroecological producers, since this crop is a highly viable alternative for the municipality of Arauquita, within the framework of the peace agreement. © The Authors, 2022.","Environmental factors; Inca peanut; Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA); Socioeconomic factors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139410871"

However, the promise of a 'Stable and lasting peace' is slipping away as the transition towards peace is increasingly tainted and overshadowed with violence. The future of Colombia is at a crossroad and without international support and action taken to monitor global supply chains, these particular drivers of conflict, violence and environmental degradation will persist. We summarize the current situation and shed light on the complexities of building peace in Colombia, with a particular focus on the environmental changes that took place since the peace agreement was signed. Technical summary The Colombian peace agreement officially ended one of the world's longest internal armed conflicts. But the transformation of land use that takes place in the wake of the peace agreement has made the historic inequalities of access to land more visible and revealed inherent and violent struggles over resources that persist across the country. In this briefing we analyse the current status of peacebuilding in Colombia and highlight the major barriers and challenges in the current peacebuilding efforts. We show how the last few years brought severe and negative repercussions for people, communities and the natural environment in Colombia as cattle ranching, 'productive agriculture' and extractive industries are increasingly encroaching into indigenous territories, protected areas and forest ecosystems, replacing diverse natural forests that support biodiversity and contribute to human well-being locally and globally. The resurging presence of numerous armed groups seeking to control the profitable drug trade and mineral deposits are a major problem and obstacle for building lasting and sustainable peace among people and with the natural environment in Colombia. We conclude this briefing with points that we see as crucial to support the implementation of the peace agreement.

Based on a set of indicators to measure social capital, and economic, sociocultural and environmental benefits perceived by the community, the case study in Minca, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Colombia), demonstrates that tourism barely benefits communities when there is insufficient social capital and unstructured governance due to the low presence of the government.

These emerge from the institutional deployment of development and peacebuilding paradigms, at least since 1982, with the creation of the National Rehabilitation Plan (PNR), the Social Solidarity Network (RSS) in 1994, the Presidential Agency for Social Action and International Cooperation in 2002, and the Department of Social Prosperity (DPS) in 2011. With the subjugation of some paramilitary groups in 2006 (Justice and Peace Law), the Victims and Land Restitution Law in 2011, and the peace agreements with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP) guerrillas in 2016, transitional institutions associated with truth, justice, and reparation proliferated, and with them, specific bureaucracies and expertise. Thus, the article specifically examines the technical and political tensions between different professional and ideological configurations associated with the implementation of reparations policy and how these disputes are essential to under-standing the moral and ideological dimensions of humanitarianism and development in Colombia. It also studies the role of cooperation agencies in inter-institutional strengthening as a specific dimension of the formation of the Colombian State. These articulations configure a moral economy of humanitarianism characterized by institutional experimentalism and the formulation of social projects, expectations, plans, and ideas that never reach the status of having been realized. This strips such policies of any transformative or emancipatory potential. Thus, from an ethnographic perspective, the article provides an account of the techno-political tensions of humanitarian bureaucracies at the middle scales of regional, national, and global institutional structures. © 2022, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

These socio-ecological and geopolitical processes and trends have increased the migration of people towards cities and accordingly are affecting the distribution and occurrence of tropical diseases in its urban and peri-urban areas. Studies have suggested that anthropogenic phenomena such as urbanization scale according to the size of human populations regardless of cultural context. But, other studies show that health epidemics such as malarial and human immunodeficiency virus infections, follow a scale-free distribution in terms of urban population size and density. Here, we explore these relationships and dynamics in a tropical context using statistical analyses and available geospatial data to identify the scale relationships between urban growth processes and disease transmission in Colombia. Our results show that the dynamics of rural populations and certain diseases were characterized by power-laws that are indeed observed in urbanization studies. However, as opposed to these other studies, we found that malaria presented a higher intensity of infection in human settlements with less than 50,000 individuals and in particular for ethnic, indigenous populations. Results indicate that disease and urbanization relationships in Colombia do indeed follow scales; findings that differ from previous epidemiological studies such as those for malarial infection. Additionally, we identified trends showing that malarial infections become endemic in peri-urban areas. This approach using few, but robust and readily available, data is key for managing public health issues and understanding the spatial distribution of environmental impacts in the urbanizing tropics. © 2022 The Author(s)","Environmental impacts; Epidemiology; Malaria; Power laws; Spatial analyses; Tropical cities","disease transmission; environmental impact; epidemiology; human immunodeficiency virus; human settlement; indigenous population; malaria; population size; power law; public health; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; tropical region; urban growth; urban population; urbanization; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131587280"

The 2016 peace agreement in Colombia has led to increasing agricultural expansion into biodiversity-rich forests. We have focused on the case of Colombia to demonstrate an approach to maximize the biodiversity benefits from limited conservation funding while ensuring that landowners maintain economic returns equivalent to agriculture. We applied a quantitative model that relates conservation investment to national biodiversity outcomes. Then we identified six regions with high potential return on investment by spatially modelling the risk of forest conversion and the expected impact of conservation actions. Our results suggest that agricultural expansion, left unchecked, would increase national biodiversity loss by 38–52% by 2033, and that doubling investment is necessary to counteract this loss. Our approach can be broadly used to target investment to weigh development and biodiversity goals. We demonstrate the approach in Colombia with its accelerated social and environmental changes and show how the efficiency of conservation options can be improved by considering opportunity cost of conservation to communities whose livelihoods depend on agriculture. This approach can be applied to other contexts to examine development and policy priorities to estimate financial needs for achieving biodiversity goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Ecosystems; Expansion; Forestry; Investments; Land use; Risk assessment; Agricultural expansion; Biodiversity loss; Colombia; Economic returns; Ecosystem services; Investment strategy; Landuse change; Peace agreements; Quantitative models; Science policies; Biodiversity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128021581"

Although efforts to address this situation, including the 2016 peace agreement signed between Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC, by Spanish acronym) are underway, these disputes continue, affecting land use dynamics. Understanding the complexity and trends in land use conflicts, as well as the specific regional characteristics underlying differing land use changes across regions, is critical. This article aims to systematically understand land use dynamics in two contrasting and conflict-affected territories in Colombia, Caquetá and Cesar, thus identifying entry points to address land-use conflicts at the regional level. To address the complexity of each regional case, we apply a methodology based on system thinking to capture the interconnections between socio-economic and environmental system components and their land use dynamics. Results depicted through causal loop diagrams not just show the cascade of environmental, social, and economic failures resulting from land use changes in these two conflict-affected territories but also suggest that land tenure systems innovations and the promotion of sustainable land use interventions at the regional level can reverse the consequences of the land use changes. Thus, future actions addressing land use conflicts must be context-dependent, tackling the root and structural causes. ©: © 2022 Del Río Duque et al.

The analysis covered the national level and the coffee region, located in the center of the country. Materials and methods included semi-structured interviews with international and national forest experts. Experts agreed that the forest sector in Colombia represents an alternative pathway for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of local populations, especially in those regions where the post-conflict process is still in effect. In the case of the coffee region, there is a reforestation potential of 54,500 ha and, with minor restrictions, the potential for 164,130 ha of forest plantations. Less than 10 % of that potential has been achieved. Likewise, there are opportunities to implement ecosystem services programs in public and private natural forests that cover 55 % of the coffee region. These potentials are not currently part of the regional priorities, although they could generate income and employment for vulnerable coffee-growing families and for indigenous communities living near natural forests, for whom poverty is a constant due to structural deprivations. © 2022, Universidad Austral de Chile.

This is partly because of the limited local understanding of the causes of forest cover changes (FCC) and how these causes relate to development. In this study, we use Colombia as a model to contribute to the understanding of the links between the causes of FCC in conflict-affected countries and policies aimed at achieving sustainable development by targeting the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectors. Specifically, we reviewed studies reporting on causes of FCC from 1995 to 2019 to build a state-of-the-art review. We then identified relevant public policies targeting AFOLU sectors and used them as a proxy for development. Finally, we discussed the links between these public policies and FCC. From the reviewed literature, it is clear that research on FCC in Colombia has focused on understanding the causes of forest cover losses while disregarding forest cover gains. Although cattle ranching and agriculture dominate the literature as proximate causes of deforestation and policy and institutional factors as underlying causes of deforestation, the relative importance of proximate and underlying causes of FCC in Colombia has changed over time. The main categories of policies that have been linked to FCC deal with conflict and post-conflict issues, coca eradication and, more recently, the implementation of the peace agreement. Another set of policies frequently mentioned are those related to productive activities. In Colombia, these policies' effects on forests will depend on how the state will regulate extractive activities in a post-conflict scenario. Therefore, it is imperative to review and update policies to tackle FCC, mainly deforestation, to successfully achieve sustainability targets in Colombia. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Colombia; Deforestation; Drivers; Peacebuilding; Post-conflict; Public policy","deforestation; forest cover; forestry policy; peace process; peacekeeping; sustainability; sustainable development; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122939959"

Studies of the intersection between mining, armed conflict and post-conflict peacebuilding portray Indigenous people as passive recipients post-conflict natural resource governance interventions. This paper challenges that perspective by demonstrating the active, highly organised and complex roles Indigenous people play in mineral resource governance in a post-agreement environment. Despite Colombian government interest in positioning high value mineral resource extraction as a platform for prosperity and peace, illegal gold mining has become a central source of finance for violent armed groups, and legal mining has been linked to threats to Indigenous rights. Many Indigenous communities in Colombia oppose mining. This paper examines Indigenous participation in natural resource governance concentrating on the resistance to certain forms of mining by the Nasa Indigenous people of North Cauca. It is based on an interpretative, layered ethnographic case study comprising archival research, interviews, and participant observation across various Nasa organisational and territorial domains. I find that the Nasa build on their strong moral and institutional frameworks for resistance to structure and implement a response to mining. I illustrate the Nasa's determinant role in post-conflict mining governance, as well as the moral tensions and dilemmas, and the risks the Nasa face in responding to mining in a violent context. © 2021","Armed conflict; Colombia; Indigenous resistance; Moral economy; Natural resource governance; Post-conflict","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110514182"

We performed time series clustering of yearly deforestation data (2001–2018) from 708 out of 1,122 mainland Colombian municipalities (accounting for 98% of the total deforestation areas in Colombia) and produced regression models using a gradient tree boosting framework (XGBoost) to identify drivers that explain varying, local-level deforestation dynamics. Municipalities were characterized by seven categories of deforestation dynamics, with the Amazon region being largely represented by only four categories and the Andes region displaying all categories of deforestation dynamics. Notably, six of the seven representative categories exhibit substantial increases in deforestation in the years following the peace agreement. The regression analysis revealed that coca cultivation area, number of cattle, and municipality area are the top three drivers of deforestation dynamics at national, regional, and category levels. However, the importance of the different variables varied according to the different spatial dimensions. Results provide further understanding on how the drivers of deforestation change not only at a regional scale, as assumed by much of the current literature about drivers of deforestation, but also at a lower scale of analysis (intraregional and intradepartmental variation in the case of Colombia). Insights from this study can be used to understand deforestation dynamics in other countries experiencing times of conflict and peace and will support decision-makers in creating programs that align actions for peacebuilding, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation more effectively. © © 2022 Ganzenmüller, Sylvester and Castro-Nunez.","climate change; Colombia; conflict; deforestation; land grabbing; peace agreement; time series clustering; XGBoost","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125830589"

The results show that the quality of life of the victims of the armed conflict, once peace agreements had been reached, remained low or medium-low. The number of victimizing events suffered and the time elapsed have little effect on the quality of life, with type of trauma being more relevant. Land-related experiences, such as expropriation, had fundamentally an influence on environmental factors. Kidnappings, sexual assaults, and events where minors were involved affected mental health. Victims of sexual assault were those whose quality of life was most affected and torture victims were those with a lower index of global quality of life. Simple passing of time did not mean quality of life increase with specific interventions being needed to repair damage.

But how do women's groups navigate gender power structures and gendered forms of violence within complex and fragile political bargaining processes aimed at ending large-scale conflict? The 2016 Colombian peace agreement, internationally applauded for its inclusion of strong gender provisions and women's participation as negotiators and peace advocates, is a significant case for examining these questions. Drawing on original case material, including interviews of key actors on different sides of the conflict-this article analyses the political bargaining dynamics within and among women's movements, the Santos government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC). We argue that the inclusion of women was pivotal in transforming the elite bargaining process and power structures of Colombian society enabling a gender-based approach to the substantive peace agenda addressing transitional gender justice for sexual violence survivors and gender-equal redistribution through land and rural reform programmes. The study suggests that deeply situated political bargaining analysis is essential to navigating gender in elite bargains rather than a one-size-fits-all approach to inclusive peace. © 2021 The Author(s).

The Colombian government has recently announced its National Bioeconomic Strategy (NBS), founded on the sustainable characterization, management, and conservation of the nation's biodiversity as a means to achieve sustainability and peace. Molecular tools will accelerate such endeavors, but capacity remains limited in Colombia. The Earth Biogenome Project's (EBP) objective is to characterize the genomes of all eukaryotic life on Earth through networks of partner institutions focused on sequencing either specific taxa or eukaryotic communities at regional or national scales. Colombia's immense biodiversity and emerging network of stakeholders have inspired the creation of the national partnership ""EBP-Colombia.""

EBP-Colombia will accelerate the uptake of technology and promote partnership and exchange of knowledge among Colombian stakeholders and the EBP's global network of experts; assist with conservation strategies to preserve Colombia's vast biological wealth; and promote innovative approaches among public and private institutions in sectors such as agriculture, tourism, recycling, and medicine. EBP-Colombia can thus support Colombia's NBS with the objective of sustainable and inclusive development to address the many social, environmental, and economic challenges, including conflict, inequality, poverty, and low agricultural productivity, and so, offer an alternative model for economic development that similarly placed countries can adopt. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

This article aims to diagnose the state of the urban parks of Tunja under the systemic approach of sustainability in urban thinking, analyzing the role they play as an essential part of public space to generate instruments of cohesion, memory, and repair within the dynamics of post-conflict as a multidimensional phenomenon. The exploratory methodology focused on field data collection, classification, and analysis of environmental, social, and economic variables, seeking relationships between their diagnosis and the topic of interest, the post-conflict. Consequently, a deficit in green area per capita (2,1 m2/inhabitant), vegetation, equipment, and poor social perception was evidenced; factors that act as limiting factors in the use, access, and identity of public space, thus concluding that the urban parks in Tunja are not acting as spaces that from a sustainability perspective can contribute to the process of reparation and social incorporation of victims of the armed conflict in Colombia. © 2022 Universidad de Chile.

The chapter examines these graphic narratives by looking at the visual and textual mechanisms they employ in conceiving, representing, and interrogating the violation of human rights discourse and practice in rural Colombia. After identifying the issues at the center of their demands, the chapter argues these works construct a narrative to display those human rights violations while proposing notions of justice and accountability, resorting to solidarity as a primary tool in that process.

The aim of this study was to identify the sociodemographic factors that affect the implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in extensive sheep systems in the Colombian post-conflict and their relationship with some health, production and economic indicators. Thirteen sheep farms located in Marulanda, Colombia were evaluated. The implementation of the GAP was determined through a structured evaluation instrument based on Colombian legislation (Res. 20277 of 2018). In addition, a sample of sheep under 1 year of age was taken from each farm to conduct clinical examinations and laboratory analysis to obtain sanitary indicators. Age (β=-0.31, p=0.04), secondary education level (β=7.91, p=0.05) and income (β=5.29, p=0.04) determined the adoption of practices contained in the GAP and these were translated in productive, sanitary and economic benefits such as the increase in the price of the live animal (r=0.85, p<0.001), weight at slaughter (r=0.57, p<0.05), hematocrit (r=0.64, p<0.05), low prevalence of Eimeria spp (r=-0.71, p<0.001) and age at slaughter (-0.74, p<0.001). The implementation of GAP in ovine systems of the Colombian post-conflict represents productive advantages; however, the age, education and economic income of the producers influence such implementation. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

Remarkably, the agreement places significant emphasis on gender as a guiding principle. Gender-related measures are at the core of Colombia’s peacebuilding efforts. Nevertheless, six years after, parties have not fully implemented these measures; a narrow understanding of the concept of violence could be one of the reasons behind this. The agreement mainly refers to the physical and dominant understanding of gender-based violence (GBV). However, this understanding is problematic. Environmental and climate-related causes are structural to the Colombian armed conflict, and critical in building peace. Environmental violence points to human-induced activities that cause harms to the environment. Climate violence, one manifestation of environmental violence, is a type of violence that worsens underlying conditions of inequalities through extreme climate conditions. Drawing on the 2016 Colombian Peace Agreement, this article focuses on the experiences of Colombian rural women to assess whether expanding dominant concepts of GBV help implement environmental peacebuilding commitments. Applying an intersectional ecofeminist reading could contribute to acknowledging particular forms of violence embedded in the climate and peace crises in Colombia during the implementation phase of gender-related peace commitments and push towards the recognition of environmental and climate violence as GBV. © 2022 Australian Feminist Law Journal Inc.","Armed conflict; climate change; environmental peacebuilding; gender-based violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144046505"

Following international commitments, the Colombian government developed national policies that respond to CC or extremes, coinciding with peace-agreements made with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces. Indeed, CC and peace are embedded issues. Conflict negatively impacts the environment and increases vulnerability to CC or extremes. Moreover, both policy areas aim for effective agricultural development. This study addresses CC adaptation and peace-agreements management as traveling models translated into policies within the agriculture sector. Drawing from development and political anthropology and the notion of a policy mix derived from political science, the analysis method employs semi-structured interviews of governmental and non-governmental actors. Accordingly, gaps exist between policy models and their local translation within the policy mix. CC management and peace governance embrace diverse actors implementing a multiplicity of dispositives concentrated along the Pan-American highway, with distinct durations, responding to diverse interests, and using several approaches. Within the scope of the policy mix, this study observes fragmentation, discontinuity, extraversion, coherence building and fight for local power. The findings can help formulate and implement more relevant policies to improve CC management and peace governance. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; Colombia; political anthropology; post-peace agreement","agricultural development; anthropology; climate change; environmental policy; policy implementation; rural development; vulnerability; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134060398"

Although the Peace Agreement of 2016 and the Integral Rural Reform offer new prospects for resolving legacies of conflict, the reconstruction of the countryside requires participation of rural communities. Social movements advance agroecology as a suitable territorial management approach for enabling the socio-ecological reconstruction of rural areas. Escuelas Campesinas de Agroecología (ECAs) are farmer-led formative initiatives that emerge around productive, market, and political processes aimed at scaling agroecology by developing new knowledge and learning systems. This qualitative study investigates the potentialities of ECAs as a social learning strategy for empowering farmer communities confronting current post-conflict challenges. Through a systematization of experiences, the work of seven ECAs is analyzed in relation to three phenomena–problematization, social networking, and critical thinking. The different pedagogies are then scrutinized based on identity frameworks. Results evidence that the context-specific approaches of ECAs enable communities to integrate diverse epistemological knowledge into collective learning systems and move it to a broader social context through social networks. We conclude that ECAs represent a suitable approach for transforming postwar environments while facilitating the achievement of peacebuilding goals. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.","family farming; peasant schools; Popular education; social movements; socio-ecological transformations","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132781121"

Based on a systematization of experiences, we analyze the work of seven farmer-led educational initiatives, so-called Agroecology Peasant Schools (Spanish: Escuelas Campesinas de Agroecología, ECAs), in three different regions of the Colombian Andes – Cauca, Valle del Cauca, and Coffee Axis. Using interviews and focus groups, we integrate the perceptions of 82 stakeholders from regional agroecology networks.

Based on the concept of territorial peace, these arrangements have a key role in the reconstruction of the collective, productive, and symbolic functions of the territory after conflicts, and in addressing conflict root causes related to land inequality. This paper contributes to the development of the concept of territorial peace by providing a framework for its operationalisation, based on three categories of arrangements, and testing it, to qualitatively explore and compare two comprehensive peace agreements: Colombia and the Philippines. Land may take the role of peacemaker in addressing territorial peace’s collective dimensions, especially when it is at the core of a peace agreement; however, its implementation remains volatile if it lacks trust, security, and technical capacity. © 2022 The Author(s).

Since the mid-nineteenth century, booms and busts of commodity production have been associated with violent struggles as actors have challenged pre-existing orders and authorities. At different times, the area has been controlled by the Catholic Church, the Colombian state, FARC and paramilitary groups, following the different boom-and-bust cycles of commodity production. We use this case to theorise on the general mechanisms behind frontier-making. Reading the frontier literature through the lens of the coloniality of power, we draw four interrelated categories to access frontier-making analytically: commodity production, dispossession, hegemon, and subjectivities. These are used to explain six distinct periods in the political economy of Caquetá and its spatial reconfigurations. We argue that current issues of distrust on the state, violence, and land grabbing, are best understood as part of a historical continuum of multiple actors keeping the area as a frontier space. © 2021 The Author(s)","Coca; Coloniality of power; Farmers; Frontiers; War on drugs","agricultural worker; colonialism; commodity; drugs trade; frontier region; political economy; power relations; territorial management; theoretical study; violence; Caqueta; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122106462"

The results of our analysis reveal four emerging roles: (1) resilient watchdog; (2) savvy expert; (3) crusader; (4) and community-embedded. The texts examined also reveal how journalists negotiated the agenda-building, since reporters were forced to limit on-site newsgathering, consult multiple sources, self-censor, and deal with the differential working conditions of metropolitan and local journalists as a consequence of risk. This study contributes to role theory by focusing on narrated roles of an insecure democracy from an inductive approach.

Previous studies on the palynological composition of this honey are insufficient and the role of native plants for the production of honey is therefore unknown. Here we present a palynological analysis of honey produced by two bee species, the introduced Apis mellifera and the native Melipona eburnea, both commonly used by low-income communities in the eastern region of the Department of Antioquia, in the Central Cordillera of Colombia. We analyzed species richness and diversity of pollen, characterized some life history traits of those species preferred by bees, and estimated the interaction web between the bee and selected plant species. The overlap between the two species was very small. We found that the source of nectar for A. mellifera were plants with different growth habits, both native and introduced. Instead, M. eburnea used mostly native tree and shrub species, at a constant height level. Our results suggest that setting bee colonies of A. mellifera close to those of M. eburnea may not result in competition between them. However, it is key to evaluate whether this pattern is the same using other sources of food, such as pollen, or in other geographic regions. © 2021 AASP–The Palynological Society.","Apis mellifera; honey; Melipona eburnea; melissopalynology; species competition","aphid; forest ecosystem; honeybee; life history trait; native species; palynology; species richness; Antioquia [Colombia]; Central Cordillera; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121382248"

This article pivots attention away from agrobiodiversity as a set of governable genetic resources to examine how the relational aspects of agrobiodiversity come to symbolize a future vision of environmental governance. Tolima residents are between two significant socio-environmental events: the 2016 Peace Accord ending decades of violent conflict and the development of an irrigation megaproject. This context creates space in which to imagine future governance relations. Drawing insights from political ecology-informed environmental governance and feminist care ethics, I show how caring material practices around native seeds translate into a vision for governance. The symbolic frame of agrobiodiversity promotes an alternative ordering of human-environment relations than that of export-oriented production, which has recently increased in southern Tolima. Methods included 42 interviews, 60 household surveys, and participant observation throughout 12 months. Findings illustrate that the caring material practices of agrobiodiversity particularly in seed exchanges, home gardens, and kitchens become a symbolic frame for environmental governance in which access to land, food, and community cohesion are ensured and protected. This research makes two contributions to the literature of agrobiodiversity. First, drawing on feminist care ethics, I argue that the caring material practices of agrobiodiversity create ‘care-full’ human-environment connections, especially important in the post-conflict context. Second, findings suggest that agrobiodiversity is not simply a set of plant materials to be governed, but also can have a strong symbolic function as a frame for environmental governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agrobiodiversity; Colombia; Development; Environmental governance; Feminist care ethics; Post-conflict","agriculture; biodiversity; ethics; governance approach; Colombia; Tolima","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100117359"

Primarily linked to unequal land distribution and subsequently to drug-trafficking, the country has diverse armed groups such as communist guerrillas, conservative paramilitary and the national army. Even though some illegal armed groups (both guerrillas and paramilitary) have demobilized through time, the most recent and comprehensive peace agreement was signed between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP in Spanish) guerrilla in 2016 (Kroc Institute, 2020). Despite the historical milestone of signing a peace accord with the oldest guerrilla in the continent, Colombian society is struggling with peacebuilding efforts, as half of the country voted against the peace agreement and the current government has not created suitable conditions for its implementation (Kroc Institute, 2020). The societal division was evident in the results of the referendum of the Peace Agreement in October 2016, where a small majority (6, 431, 376 [50.21%] vs. 6, 377, 482 [49.78%]) voted against the peace accord. As a result, the peace agreement was adjusted, but the sentiment among the “no” voters was that the agreement did not offer structural change and, therefore, was not to be supported. © 2022 Information Age Publishing Inc.","","'current; Armed conflict; Armed forces; Colombia; Colombians; Critical service; Drug trafficking; Peace accords; Peace agreements; Service learning","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105028239510"

An exploration of a case study of protracted drought in an agricultural region of Bolivar, Colombia, demonstrates how landlessness, socioeconomic vulnerability, and confusion regarding complicated land tenure policies in a post-conflict environment guided families’ resilience strategies and adaptive capacities. This case demonstrates that it is necessary to nuance understandings of (in)secure tenure to include local knowledge of land policies and precarious tenure claims as predictors of adaptive capacities in vulnerable, climate-stressed regions. © Te Editor(s) (if applicable) and Te Author(s) 2022.

The research identifies how cuerpo-territorio is an epistemological starting point that emerges from reinterpreting their worldviews and helps explain the ontological relationship between body, territory, identity, and spirituality. Unpacking this premise, the cuerpo-territorio approach to peace and conflict implies a more reflective and holistic understanding, including other dimensions and ethos. Dispossession of ancestral lands, exploitation of territory, forced displacement and violence against women constitute personal and collective harms that create imbalance and disharmony. Finally, the analysis states that by adopting intersectional and decolonial approaches in critical peace studies, we can shed light on what is silenced by dominant approaches and challenge the limits of institutional and anthropocentric conceptions. Likewise, this “inclusion” must nevertheless be accompanied by material conditions since, despite the signing of the Havana Peace Agreement, indigenous peoples remain under the crossfire of armed actors in their ancestral territories. © 2021 Blanquerna School of Communication and International Relations.

Finally, it is suggested that the conservation of the latifundismo remains not only the greatest obstacle to the search for solutions to the armed conflict and the construction of a more just and equitable society, but also for the existence of a unitary and modern State in Colombia. © Historia Actual Online.","land market; land policy; latifundismo; social order of rural property; territorial property","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150660074"

Fostering social cohesion might present a potential to enhance the connection of natural resource management and peacebuilding and better functioning of sustainable land use systems. This contribution explores the nexus between social cohesion, natural resource management, and peacebuilding. We do so by (1) reviewing literature on the three concepts and (2) studying four different key action areas in the context of sustainable cocoa production for their potential to enhance social cohesion, namely (a) agroforestry; (b) cooperatives; (c) certification schemes; and (d) trade policies. Research is based on experience from cocoa production in two post-conflict countries, Côte d’Ivoire and Colombia. Our findings show that by fostering environmentally sustainable agricultural practices, these key action areas have a clear potential to foster social cohesion among cocoa producers and thus provide a valuable contribution to post-conflict peacebuilding in both countries. However, the actual effects strongly depend on a multitude of local factors which need to be carefully taken into consideration. Further, the focus in implementation of some of these approaches tends to be on increasing agricultural productivity and not directly on fostering cocoa farmers’ wellbeing and societal relations, and hence a shift toward social objectives is needed in order to strengthen these approaches as a part of overall peacebuilding strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Most of the research in the field of agrarian studies in Colombia has focused on inequalities in land distribution, the impacts of violent conflict, and most recently, the first phase of the peace agreement implementation. This book links and complements these literatures by critically engaging with an original framework that uncovers the conflicts and politics of food provisioning: Who produces what and where, and with what socio-economic effects. This analytical lens is used to explain the re-emergence of national agrarian movements, their contestation of the dominant development narratives and their engagement in discussions about food sovereignty with the state. The analysis incorporates a wide range of voices from high-level government representatives and leaders from national agrarian movements. Their narratives of food provisioning and the broader role of the food industry are reviewed and the key findings show an underlying conflict within food provisioning based on the struggle of marginalised smallholders to develop alternative agri-food systems that can be included in the local and domestic food markets in the context of a state dominated by an export and import approach. Overall, the book argues that the battle ground of agrarian conflicts has moved to the fi eld of food provisioning and using this approach has the potential to reframe the debate about the future of food and agriculture in Colombia and beyond. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of food and agriculture, rural development, peasant studies, and Latin American Studies. © 2022 Felipe Roa-Clavijo.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112788312"

For more than 50 years, an internal war in the country has shaped this region. Peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) initiated in 2012 resulted in a progressive de-escalation of violence and a complete ceasefire in 2016. This study explores the role of different deforestation drivers including armed conflict variables, in explaining deforestation for three periods between 2001 and 2015. Iterative regression analyses were carried out for two spatial extents: the entire Colombian Amazon and a subset area which was most affected by deforestation. The results show that conflict variables have positive relationships with deforestation; yet, they are not among the main variables explaining deforestation. Accessibility and biophysical variables explain more variation. Nevertheless, conflict variables show divergent influence on deforestation depending on the period and scale of analysis. Based on these results, we develop deforestation risk maps to inform the design of forest conservation efforts in the post-conflict period. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deforestation; Forest conservation; Logistic regression; Tropical rainforest; War","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110757927"

These processes foster the co-production of landscapes where both human beings and nature undergo mutual transformations under the conception that social and natural processes are hybridization processes. The methodology used allowed identifying the landscape configuration processes ranging from landscape experience and observation, using ethnographic and geographic tools such as field diary, photographs, reading, review and elaboration of cartography, interpretation of aerial and satellite images, elaboration of educational graphs, and tours. This methodology supported the description of landscapes from their profiles and textures emerged from the interactions between human, biological and feature elements. In this way, this article reflects on the experiences herein understood as nodes that cluster the interactions between peasants, resulting in material assets resulting from the activities of humans and other living organisms; to this end, we developed descriptions and analyses considering four landscapes. The first was built around forest-related activities and agriculture for self-consumption between the 1950s and 1970s through maize crops, hunting and mule-driving. As regards the experience on maize, we reflected on the actions and knowledge involved; as regards hunting, we explain the dynamics between the territorialities of peasants and animals fighting for their territory and life form, and on mule-driving, we outline the relationship of transiting landscapes by roads connecting farmland areas with other landscapes and territories. The second landscape, identified between the decades of 1980s and 1990s, was developed from coffee cultivation and the emergence of guerrilla (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army]). In this new landscape, coffee cultivation drives the timing and transit of peasants according to culture altitude; regarding the guerrilla, Rio Verde de los Montes was territorialized for recruitment, hiding and healing place, favored by the abundant forests and remoteness. The war and peasant-displacement landscape was driven by territorial disputes through military actions by FARC-EP, the Magdalena Medio Peasant's Self-Defense group (ACMM), and the National Army. The military territorialization and fear-inducing practices prevailed in this landscape, resulting in the de-territorialization of multiple peasant families that abandoned their land; as a result, the typical rural spaces including households and cropland were altered, as well as the interactions with non-human elements. The last landscape, which was recorded from the year 2000 to 2016, is characterized by re-territorialization from the return and new interactions fostered by access to electricity services and sale of environmental services. This return is marked by a re-encounter with households and land, as well as with wild areas that invaded these spaces under the absence of peasants. The supply of household electricity allow new practices as well as the reconfiguration of others resulting from the use of electric appliances and machinery. Finally, the sale of ecosystemic services defines the forest as a conservation area and the peasant as a supplier of environmental services. We conclude that from the various interactions with other actors, materials and living organisms, the peasant builds territorializations through time and creates new landscapes from the overlap with other human and non-human territorialities. This analysis was achieved through post-human geography, for which the use of ethnography was right, as this approach allowed to gain experience in the territory and come closer to the perspective of rural families. Finally, we believe this article sets the basis of a different approach to analyze the processes leading to and shaping landscapes within the rural context in Colombia. © 2021 Instituto de Geografia.

This region is suitable for growing diverse crops ranging from staple crops and livestock to high-valued commodities such as cacay (a nut whose oil is used in the cosmetic industry). OBJECTIVE: The model suggested an optimal portfolio of agricultural enterprises for a representative farm that maximizes revenues net of variable costs and returns to resource endowments. Traditional agricultural enterprises were assessed, as well as some others that appear to be promising possibilities for Altillanura. METHODS: A linear programming model (LP) was designed to support the assessment of the relative profitability of agricultural enterprises in a post-conflict era as a response for the need to reduce agricultural net imports, satisfy a growing domestic food demand and boost economic and social development. RESULTS and CONCLUSION: A major finding was that labor shortages in the region are a key constraint for perennial crops such as oil palm, cacay, and cashew. Inclusion of mechanized crops like rice, corn, and soybean can help to alleviate this limitation, resulting in the preferred farm choice among the conventional farm activities. Integrated (Crop + Hog) operation is the most profitable among promising enterprises, but its operation size would be constrained by access to processing plants and marketing strategies. Cacay and cashew represent a viable option for farms to increase net returns using high-valued perennial crops. SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, cattle production on native savannas is the most common agricultural activity in the region, but this model challenged this status quo by identifying other more profitable alternatives that include improved production systems for cattle, hogs, and crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Farm resource allocation model; Linear programming; Net revenue maximization; Post-conflict agriculture; Rural development","agricultural development; cattle; environmental assessment; identification method; industrial enterprise; linear programing; profitability; Colombia; Anacardium occidentale; Elaeis; Glycine max","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109187351"

Recent study efforts to understand this issue suffer from data scarcity and limited consultation of local stakeholder perspectives on factors affecting wildfires. This study uses a social–ecological systems framework to investigate local perceptions of factors driving and/or preventing wildfires in the Los Picachos, La Macarena and Tinigua PAs, which are shared by two Amazonian departments experiencing wildfire increase. Four stakeholder categories were selected to represent varied and possibly conflicting interests: cattle ranchers, the national park service, local authorities and cross-sectional stakeholders. We combined a participative mapping approach with interviews to illustrate stakeholder perceptions of interactions between key variables in graphical causal models. Network analyses were used to determine areas of agreement on key variables, and to compare local priorities with those of key informants at the national level. Local stakeholders and key informants widely agreed on the roles of extensive cattle ranching and land grabbing as key drivers of wildfires. The analysis identified areas for further research into wildfire occurrence within PAs. These include lack of governance and untitled land, as well as the effects of poor access to basic public services on unsustainable ranching methods. This study revealed contested opinions between ranchers and other stakeholders over interactions between ranching, roads and illicit crops, and consequently their effects on wildfire occurrence. This indicates the need for cautious implementation of the National Development Plan, prioritising road maintenance over expansion, integrating arable alternatives to cattle ranching and considering multiple stakeholders in regional decision-making around wildfire reduction. The strengths and limitations of the participative mapping approach employed here are discussed with a view to aiding decision-making in post-conflict regions of the Global South. © 2021 The Authors.

Whether or not active global conflicts are declining in number remains hotly debated, the number of countries entering post-conflict periods is on the rise, and the impact of this transition on land cover changes remains poorly understood. In Colombia, though large-scale armed conflict has concluded, the post-conflict period represents an ongoing threat to forest conservation, putting at risk commitments to meet global conservation goals and even those stipulated in the peace accord. This paper aims to assess land cover change associated with the Colombian conflict in the Andes-Amazon region between 1988 and 2019. First, we use the Landsat archive to map land cover and characterize the spatial patterns of change at the regional level. Second, to empirically identify the effect of conflict on land cover change, we employ a difference-in-difference approach using local conflict events data. During conflict (1988–2011), land cover in the Andes-Amazon remained relatively stable, however during the post-conflict period (2012–2019), the conversion from forest to agriculture increased by 40%. We find that forest cover surrounding conflict events (1 km radius) decreased significantly, on average by ~ 19% during conflict, which accelerated to ~ 30% in the post-conflict period. Similarly, agriculture expansion is most substantial during the post-conflict period, but exclusively in municipalities with population below the 50th percentile. Landscape metrics show that in peripheral municipalities (<50th), agriculture occurs in clumped distributions during the conflict period. Meanwhile, during the post-conflict period, this expansion happens more quickly, with significantly greater agricultural patch sizes than during the conflict period. We conclude that a slow implementation of conservation governance, the emergence of illegal land markets, and illicit land uses (i.e., coca and illegal cattle ranching) may accelerate land cover change in the coming years. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Armed conflict; Land cover change; Landsat; Landscape metrics; Post-conflict","civil war; forest cover; forest ecosystem; land classification; land cover; Landsat; landscape change; landscape ecology; spatiotemporal analysis; Amazonia; Andes; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105873845"

Forest loss depends on multiple drivers that relate to ecological and socio-economic conditions, and varies significantly in time and space. Understanding the causes and potential consequences of forest loss in a region, requires detailed knowledge of the spatial and temporal behavior of deforestation drivers. This is especially important in Colombia, a country with an immense geographical, ecological and cultural diversity. In this work we use a spatially-explicit modeling platform to identify the influence of multiple deforestation drivers in different biogeographical and planning regions of Colombia. Models were used to produce different deforestation scenarios, resulting in contrasting trends. Results suggest that agricultural activities have a significant role in deforestation in Colombia, although its influence largely varies among regions. Notably, the long-lasting internal conflict in the country, indicated here by a proxy variable, produced contrasting effects on historical deforestation, such that in some areas it acted as an attractor and in some others as a deterrent of deforestation. Our scenarios for the mid-21st century indicate that current trends in deforestation and its drivers (except the internal conflict due to a recent peace agreement) can potentially lead to major ecological impacts, such as fragmentation and loss of connectivity among ecosystems. In the Governance scenario, however, enforcement of conservation in protected areas ensures partial forest conservation, highlighting the key relevance of these areas for biodiversity conservation in the country and for controlling the expansion of deforestation. Given the high spatial and temporal variability of deforestation, and that the same drivers can lead to different responses in different geographic areas, decision-making needs a more efficient approach for designing locally-adapted measurements to face current challenges of conservation and management of forests and their services. © 2021 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; Deforestation modeling; Dinamica EGO; Forest loss; Land transformation","Biodiversity; Decision making; Deforestation; Ecology; Environmental protection; Geographical regions; 'current; Biodiversity conservation; Colombia; Deforestation modeling; Dinamica EGO; Environmental governances; Forest loss; Land transformation; Spatial temporals; Temporal dynamics; Conservation; biodiversity; conservation management; conservation status; decision making; deforestation; ecological impact; governance approach; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; protected area; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104398900"

By taking a historical perspective on regional deforestation challenges in Guaviare, we link these challenges to the recent deforestation trends in the region.

The intention of transforming this context was manifested in the peace treaty of 2016 between the Colombian Government (2010-2018) and FARC guerrilla. During the second half of the twentieth century, society has experienced the consequences of this conflict, which are evidenced in the prioritization of violence as a mechanism to mediate differences. Because of this, it is necessary to display the different ways in which society is being prepared to live in a peaceful environment. One of the most important areas to accomplish this is the education system (pre-school, middle school, high school, College, university etc.). In the following research two schools and their experiences are studied (IED Antonio Jose Uribe and Colegio Santa Francisca Romana located in Bogota) using mixed methods such as, surveys, interviews and workshops.

Where long-run economic sustainability and human well-being are concerned, GDP can provide misleading policy advice. While the limitations of GDP are discussed conceptually in the literature, we provide a quantitative example demonstrating the implications of using only GDP to inform policy design. In the context of Colombia's post-conflict development, we show that continuing the recent trend of increasing deforestation reflects positively on GDP by about US$59 million by 2035. However, when we consider the natural capital assets and environmental quality that underpin economic growth summarized by the Genuine Savings indicator of wealth, reducing deforestation and enhancing agricultural productivity results in a more prosperous and sustainable post-conflict future for Colombia with a US$48 billion increase in wealth. Policy makers relying only on GDP as a guide to policy effectiveness risk undermining their country's development prospects and inter-generational well-being which is at the very core of sustainable development. While natural capital accounting sheds light on past economy-environment interactions, future looking integrated analytical frameworks such as that presented in this paper are required to evaluate policies on the basis of their potential impacts on sustainable economic development and wealth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Economic impact analysis; Ecosystem services; Gross domestic product (GDP); Integrated economic-environmental modeling (IEEM) platform; Natural capital accounting; Wealth","deforestation; economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental quality; Gross Domestic Product; guideline; land use change; natural capital; sustainability; Colombia; Indicator indicator","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099180421"

In Colombia, the coca production -considered a war economy- granted peasant women a source of access to productive resources (land, credit and seeds) and paid work, conditions that are difficult to find in other legal agrarian economies. For this reason, policies pursuing a transition from war to peace, such as the ones that emerged from the 2016 Peace Agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla, must incorporate a gender perspective in order to acknowledge the social progress that women can achieve in war scenarios. Methods: The empirical evidence comes from thirty-one in-depth and semi-structured interviews with cocalero peasants, social leaders and public officials; ethnographic fieldwork in two municipalities with the highest levels of illicit crop production (Puerto Asís and Tumaco); official documents of anti-drug and Alternative Development policies in Colombia, and other official information from the agencies in charge of implementing these policies; and data from the survey of participants of the National Comprehensive Program for the Substitution of Illicit Crops (PNIS) (National University of Colombia, 2019), and one dataset from the Colombian National Administrative Department of Statistics (the Quality of Life Survey of 2018). For the analysis of the data we used an open-codification method and conducted hypothesis tests with Welch's correction. Results: In Colombia, women involved in the coca economy experience a degree of empowerment that leads to increased income, time control and decision-making power. When we compared the lived experience of cocalero women with what the National Crop Substitution Programme -PNIS- offers, we found that the programme falls short from offering viable gender-sensitive alternatives, producing a setback in women's empowerment. Conclusion: Illicit crop economies in war contexts can be a source of social advancement for marginalized populations, particularly women. Thus, peace policies that do not recognise these advances, i.e. that do not incorporate a gender perspective in their design, deepen gender-based inequalities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Colombia; Gender studies; Illicit economies; Peace process; Rural women","agricultural worker; Article; cacao; cocalero; Colombia; crop production; decision making; economic aspect; empowerment; ethnography; female; gender equity; human; income; leadership; peace policy; priority journal; public policy; semi structured interview; social aspect; time management; war; coca; policy; quality of life; Coca; Female; Humans; Policy; Quality of Life","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101157254"

However, without a comprehensive development strategy and deep transformative reform addressing structural issues (land, resources, market access, etc.), it is a war bound to be lost despite enormous human suffering. In Colombia, agrarian development came as the first topic in the agenda between the FARC-EP and the government during the latest peace negotiations (2012-2016), recognising its intimate link to illicit drugs. This recognition went against the grain of dominant discourses. However, the agreement fell short of much needed transformative reform. Moreover, it also failed to engage with the governance mechanisms –enforced and sustained by the rebels- which were key to social order in many drug-producing regions. By exploring the case of Argelia, in South-Western Colombia, I will argue that a transformative approach to peace-building was needed, as rural development and engagement with local governance mechanisms in drug-producing regions are paramount to address effectively the problem of illicit crops. © 2021 The Author","Cocaine; Colombia; FARC-EP; Illicit Crops; Peace Agreement; Rebel Governance","cocaine; agricultural management; Article; Colombia; drug manufacture; drug traffic; economic aspect; government; human; interpersonal communication; legal aspect; military phenomena; priority journal; rural area; coca; war; Armed Conflicts; Coca; Cocaine; Humans; Illicit Drugs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097748211"

While much international coverage of the crisis has focused on Cúcuta, the major border crossing in the department of Norte de Santander, the crossing via the Guajira Peninsula is the second most frequented official land crossing into Colombia. In 2020, La Guajira was home to more than 166,000 refugees and migrants, the third highest concentration in the country. This happened at the same time as new and old armed groups were using violent measures to control strategic territory in the region. This practice note takes stock of the risks that affect security conditions as perceived and experienced by communities in La Guajira, and outlines the self-protection strategies that some communities employ to respond to the changing security conditions. It demonstrates the need for enhancing efforts for integration (for example, documentation) and response mechanisms that are shared between Colombia and other countries in the region in order to mitigate risks for Venezuelans in border regions of Colombia.

Looking for similarities and differences in the implementation of agrarian reforms in the four countries, the methodology included various parts. First, existing agrarian reforms and armed conflicts were identified, based on which, the selection of countries has been carried out. Second, once the countries were selected, the different stages of the corresponding conflict were analyzed (Pre-, In- and Post-conflict). Finally, the stages were compared with the Colombian case and insights have been drawn. Results from the comparative analysis reveal that the typology of the agrarian reform, the power relationship between elites, and the socioeconomic inequality are the most influential factors in the Colombian post-conflict stage. Based on these, I suggest that the new agrarian reform in Colombia does not fulfill the conditions for peace construction based on fair access to and distribution of the land. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","agrarian reform; Colombia; internal armed conflict; peace process; post-conflict","agrarian reform; historical perspective; implementation process; peace process; political conflict; power relations; socioeconomic status; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092756326"

Many parallels can be drawn between these experiences: both countries decided to restitute land in an effective manner but also excluded groups of victims - which was accepted by both countries' constitutional courts. Important differences emerge regarding the function of restitution for the resolution of the conflict and in its implementation in practice. These differences are owed to the different origins and causes of the conflicts, and to different circumstances prevailing at the time of restitution. It can be clearly shown that post-conflict restitution of land is very context-sensitive. Neither in Germany nor in Colombia were the objectives of the restitution regimes, individual justice and further policy aims, fully achieved. Nevertheless, the considerable extent to which justice was indeed attained by restitution should not be talked down or diminished. © 2019 The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168118820"

The author contends that other types of decentralized cooperation equally directed to ‘build peace’ are taking the place of international peacebuilding. She states that the decline of the main approach of the liberal peacebuilding paradigm translates into the empowerment of other and numerous actors and the boost of a variety of approaches to peace and methods to achieve it, like the inclusion of land issues. This chapter thereby illustrates the above-mentioned dynamic through the case of the implementation of the Peace Agreement, signed in 2016 between the Colombian government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the inclusion of the Peasant Reserve Zones as a peacebuilding tool, which she describes as embodying an auto-affirmative approach that challenges the capitalistic presuppositions of international peacebuilding. © 2021, The Author(s).","Colombia; Land; Peace agreement; Peacebuilding; Peasant Reserve Zones; Rural reform","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145205868"

The main premise is that the effects of an erratic climate has an indirect but relevant influence in the emergence of new forms of violence. In other words, the climatic change and environmental degradation act as a “stressor” in different forms of violence in this commodity-based economy recovering from more than 50 years of internal armed conflict. The qualitative approach is based on semi-structured interviews with government representatives and academics to track different perspectives. It is argued that key environmental and climate-related issues in new forms of conflict after the peace deal are linked to the fragmentary distribution and control of land, the ongoing forced migration patterns, and expansion of a new and more lucrative illicit economy. © 2022 by IGI Global.

The educational process in educational institutions of basic and middle level includes axiological training based on the declaration of a system of values, which are deployed from public policies and are translated into the Institutional Educational Project–PEI and the manual of coexistence; these do not always correspond to the values perceived, appropriated and practiced by the academic communities. In a country like Colombia, in terms of post-conflict, the values for the culture of peace become relevant, given that a lasting and structural peace does not depend only on the government and the guerrilla groups, so in fact the National Conciliation Commission–CNN (2013) establishes as minimum reconciliation among others the “Generation of a culture of peace”. Objective. The present work intends to make an analysis with the academic community of a public school in the Valle of Aburrá, who have experienced different types of violence, to know the values they promote for peace and nonviolence, to understand their dynamics in contrast to the institutionality and its impact on school education and coexistence.

This research proposes the sociocritical methodological approach from which the phenomenon of training will be studied in its axiological dimension from the system of universal values defined by multilateral entities such as the United Nations and UNESCO and that today promotes the national government, the national education ministry and educational institutions in contrast to the imaginations that academic communities have in this regard in relation to the culture of peace and nonviolence. Results. Among the most frequent problems that the academic community identifies within EI are physical and verbal abuse, bullying, fights, drugs and discrimination; and in the environment, that is, outside the Institution, they also identify crime, intolerance, discrimination, gender violence, lack of love and lack of communication, all these forms of violence that young people identify clearly, which in turn are replicated in the institutional environment. Conclusion. The analysis, shared values are established as a common good, their importance, their conflicts and the way they are resolved within the academic community. © 2021, Revista Lasallista de Investigacion.

Santos highlighted increased militarization of the territory as one advantage of the corridor. In this model, ecological conservation becomes a matter of national/natural security, in the form of counterinsurgency to counter illegal economies. Climate change and ecological disaster mean the forest needs the military power of the State to save it from destruction. We argue that such conservation entails a form of necropolitics lying in wait; because to conserve one part is to condemn the other - framed as the enemy - to certain destruction, as land is simultaneously designated for large-scale development projects. Conservation, in effect, becomes tied to a form of extinction. Our article examines two increasingly militarized frontiers that work through conservation in Colombia. The first is where the Andes meets the Amazon rainforest, an area that has seen an increase in deforestation following the 2016 Peace Agreement with the FARC. Deforestation is often attributed to the cultivation of coca (used to produce cocaine), and the solution posited by the government is to eradicate the plant. We argue that eradication of illicit crops is a form of enforced extinction that militarizes the forest, targeting both human and non-human inhabitants. The second frontier concerns coal mining on the Caribbean coast, where mass environmental devastation induced by the industry has led to a forced reorganization of life in the region. The military guards the sites of extraction and those who oppose coal mining become targets for elimination. We bring these two cases - coal and coca - into dialogue, to trace the extinction-driven expansion of extractive economies, a process intertwined with armed conflict, narcotrafficking, and now, with transitional politics. © 2021.

To do so, I specify some factors that prevent the application of the law related to anomalies of Colombian democracy and a development model based on accumulation by dispossession. There are multiple institutional obstacles as the absence of updated cadastral data on extension, boundaries, and physical location of rural properties; besides the ineffectiveness of justice that is subject to multiple horizontally and vertically fragmented powers in national and territorial institutions. This has prevented the application of Law 1448 of 2011, also called the Law of Victims and Land Restitution, and of Decrees Law 4633 and 4635 of 2011 on the claim of the rights of indigenous and Afro-descendants in territories violated by war. Currently, the presence of new paramilitary groups and the killing of social leaders of the Community Councils has increased. The article seeks to analyze the cultural characteristics and community policies that are characteristic of the Colombian Pacific riparian culture, as potentials for the preservation of collective rights in community processes of civil resistance for the right of life and territory; in the face of circumstances of recent victimizing events, the investigation records the current resistance process, with complaints before the Special Justice for Peace (jep) and with the completion of the Humanitarian Caravan for Peace towards Chocó.

Using the 2018–2019 exhibition Voces para transformar a Colombia, we show that considering a non-human element such as water in this context requires a methodological reflection about how to expand the notion of victimhood to include nature. After decades of armed conflict, the Colombian government initiated a transitional justice process which led to the creation of the Museum of Memory as a setting for post-conflict reconciliation. This museum-pilot exhibition approached violence and resistance in the armed conflict through three main axes: land, water, and the human body. Unlike land and the body, water has played only a marginal role in the public understanding of the armed conflict. The article analyzes the curatorial process underlying the creation of the Water axis of this exhibition. In light of this exhibition, we propose a reflection on what Nicholas Thomas calls “the museum as a method,” which involves three specific moments: discovery, captioning, and juxtaposition. We suggest a fourth moment, ramification, whereby the exhibition branches off through alliances with communities and scholars, and technologies that geographically decenter the museum. The water axis allows for a broader reflection about violence and the environment in which science and the arts come together to create citizens' engagement with justice and ecological crisis. From this perspective, the analysis of the water axis advances the burgeoning field of the blue humanities. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102145360"

Although much research has focused on economic consequences, understanding the real impact of conservation on local populations requires a more holistic standpoint. Using quasi-experimental matching methods and a diachronic perspective, the biodemographic and socio-economic effects of Colombia’s National Natural Parks (NNPs) were evaluated (all in a context of internal conflict and post-conflict). The analyses were made for the set of NNPs and then grouped into four natural regions (Andes, Caribbean, Amazon-Orinoquía and Pacific) and two conflict intensities. Differences were found mainly for NNPs with low-intensity conflict, but only for biodemographic variables, not for socio-economic ones. Starting from a situation of disadvantage, a relative improvement in the conditions of the NNP municipalities was observed throughout the 13-year period in relation to the control group. Results should be taken with caution due to the conflict situation, but the lack of correlation between biodemographic and socio-economic aspects highlights the need to include more complex approaches in protected area management policies. © 2020 by the authors.

The establishment of protected areas (PAs) is a worldwide conservation strategies, but some PAs are not effective in avoiding deforestation. On the other hand, armed conflicts have ambiguous effects on wildlife. Colombia is a megadiverse country that not only has a huge network of PAs but also shows a high deforestation rate and a 50-years-old armed conflict. Here, we assessed the impact of the Colombian PAs and the FARC-EP guerrilla (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) occupation areas in avoiding deforestation in the country. For that, we compared the forest cover of PAs and FARC areas with environmentally similar control areas to assess forest loss from 2000 to 2017. We found that only large Colombian PAs were effective in avoiding deforestation over the last 17 years and that FARC presence increased deforestation in the country. Our results showed that the establishment of PA alone is not enough to ensure a positive conservation outcome. Our study offered a broad-scale analysis of Colombian PA impacts in avoiding deforestation as well as FARC's role in forest loss. Colombia has several challenges to reduce its deforestation rate and to enhance the impact of PA in avoiding deforestation. Those challenges include the solution of the land tenure conflict, improvement of current legislation, strengthening governance, and conflict resolution. Further, Colombia needs to deal with obstacles derived from armed conflict itself, particularly in the historic FARC areas, where fundamental conservation efforts are mostly needed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Armed conflict; Conservation policy; Counterfactual thinking; Impact evaluation; Matching; Policy design","conservation planning; deforestation; environmental legislation; environmental monitoring; forest cover; governance approach; land tenure; protected area; wildfire; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097549951"

Yet, little research adresses the potential of domestic transitional justice instruments to provide victims with access to remedy. This article seeks to better understand the functioning of such instruments by presenting a case study of the land restitution mechanism in Colombia. This mechanism constitutes a far-reaching remedy framework for cases of land dispossession, in which business actors appropriated the land of forcibly displaced persons, including extensive legal assistance measures, shifts and reductions in the burden of proof and a binding due diligence obligation for investors. However, its implementation has been rather weak. Drawing on qualitative interviews with experts involved in land restitution proceedings against business actors, the article identifies the main obstacles to these proceedings and develops recommendations on how to improve transitional justice instruments so as to redress victims of business-related human rights violations in post-conflict settings. © 2020 The Author(s).

To counter risks to agribusiness’ reputation, sustainability certifications legitimize investments fulfilling certain production criteria. But do such certifications ensure local populations’ land access? This paper investigates the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and argues that its definition of sustainability fails to ensure such land access for two reasons: (1) It refers to land rights instead of recognizing the human right to land (2) It promotes contract farming as win-win. By focusing on local contexts and practices in Colombia, field research provides evidence that to ensure local populations’ land access, the RSPO should opt for a human rights approach. For the Colombian peace process, this result means that the RSPO’s current definition of sustainability is not in line with the integral rural reform planned in the peace agreement. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Colombia; human rights; Land grabbing; palm oil; post-conflict; practices","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079415847"

First, through participatory work carried out with a community, the citizen factors were identified, evaluated, and systematized in relation to the problems and needs of the region. Second, based on the results obtained, a simulation model based on system dynamics—which facilitates decision-making with regard to the evaluation of green projects—was calibrated. The proposed methodology lead to the conclusion that, with the participation of the community, and with a model based on the dynamics of the variables—such as supply and demand—for natural water and land resources, it is possible to warn decision-makers about variables that can lead to the maximization of investments, and thus to prioritize and select the most appropriate environmental, social, or economic initiatives that meet the needs or expectations of the involved community. In the future, the model could be used to facilitate the management, administration, and control of water and land resources by creating alerts called reserve margins. © 2020 by the authors.

However, many PAs around the world exist on paper only; thus, while logging and habitat conversion may be banned in these areas, illegal activities often continue to cause alarming habitat destruction. In such cases, the presence of armed conflict may ultimately prevent incursions to a greater extent than the absence of conflict. Although there are several reports of habitat destruction following cessation of conflict, there has never been a systematic and quantitative “before-and-after-conflict” analysis of a large sample of PAs and surrounding areas. Here we report the results of such a study in Colombia, using an open-access global forest change dataset. By analysing 39 PAs over three years before and after Colombia’s peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), we found a dramatic and highly significant increase in the deforestation rate for the majority of these areas and their buffer zones. We discuss the reasons behind such findings from the Colombian case, and debate some general conservation lessons applicable to other countries undergoing post-conflict transitions. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082055962"

The withdrawal of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) after the Peace Agreement with the government of Colombia in 2016, has brought new dynamics in access and uses of land leading to increasingly visible social-environmental impacts across the country. Social and environmental transformations are taking place in Colombia's highlands and páramo areas, which supply 70% of the country's freshwater. Yet, there is little understanding how these transformations occur. We conducted ethnographic fieldwork focusing on the experiences of local actors in natural resource access in Combia village, which was controlled by the FARC for over two decades until 2016. Combia is located in the Las Hermosas mountain region in the southwest of the country. Our interviews and revision of local and regional policy documents show how the transition from the social order under FARC control to a State-regulated phase led to an interplay of new actors and new authority figures which in turn reconfigure local land distribution and control over water. The shift of power as a direct result of the peace agreement and the retraction of the FARC reinforces unequal access to land and water, particularly for peasants without land ownership, which ironically has been the core issue in Colombia's protracted armed conflict. © Copyright © 2020 Betancur-Alarcón and Krause.","armed conflict; Colombia; peace agreement; political ecology; water access","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096025932"

However, due to the signing of the peace agreement and the growing number of fatalities in road crashes, it is possible that soon traffic fatalities will be the primary cause of violent deaths in the country, particularly in urban areas. This study is an exploratory analysis focused on identifying the main factors associated with the severity of traffic crashes in urban areas, using Cartagena as a case study. We analyzed three levels of crash severity, namely fatal, injury, and property-damage-only, considering factors in several different dimensions: victim, vehicle, road infrastructure, traffic and control, day and time, and environmental factors. A modeling approach based on multinomial ordered discrete models was used to properly identify the main factors associated with the severity levels. We found that the probability of fatal accidents is higher on streets with speed limits over 40 km/h, and that males and people aged 60 years or older are the victims with the most significant risk of fatal crashes. Motorcycles were also identified as vehicles with the highest probability of fatal crashes in the city. We showed that the probability of fatal crashes occurring is higher on streets where pedestrian bridges, traffic lights, and crosswalks are present. These findings are worthy because, in Colombia and other developing countries, the authorities normally expect to reduce the probability of fatal accidents through investments in pedestrian bridges, signaling devices, and crosswalk markings. However, according to our results, it possibly will not occur unless further countermeasures are taken. Based on these findings, reducing speed limits, operational improvements at signalized intersections, zero tolerance for traffic violations related to pedestrians, an awareness campaign on pedestrian safety focused on males and people aged 60 or older, and improving motorcycle safety are the countermeasures we proposed. Furthermore, as the authorities make significant efforts to investing in pedestrian bridges, we propose a further investigation into the traffic crashes in streets where there is this infrastructure since more severe events occur near them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Countermeasures; Crosswalks; Multinomial model; Pedestrian bridges; Traffic crash severity","Crosswalks; Developing countries; Disasters; Factor analysis; Footbridges; Highway accidents; Investments; Motorcycles; Probability; Street traffic control; Traffic signals; Traffic signs; Awareness campaigns; Environmental factors; Exploratory analysis; Operational improvements; Property damage only; Road infrastructures; Signalized intersection; Traffic fatalities; Pedestrian safety; adult; aged; Colombia; epidemiology; female; human; injury; injury scale; male; middle aged; mortality; prevention and control; traffic accident; urban population; young adult; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aged; Built Environment; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Middle Aged; Urban Population; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090353285"

This rapid growth coincided with a period of extreme armed conflict and displacement, with inequality in land distribution reaching the highest levels in Latin America (Oxfam, 2017). These occurrences spurred this inquiry into conditions on the ground in the palm growing zones and the political and economic forces promoting the crop. The theoretical underpinnings are derived from the literature on land grabbing, land control, land concentration and exclusion. Oil palm has been favoured by rural elites, conservative governments and right-wing paramilitaries in an attempted ‘modernising’ of the countryside through agro-industry. Neo-liberal ideas emphasising capital accumulation through the ‘market’ have minimised land reform efforts and impeded post-conflict land restitution. The paper is organised in three main parts. Part 1 introduces the crop and its importance, linked to oil palm's culture of continuous expansion. Relevant theoretical concepts are discussed, together with the background to land and violence in Colombia. Part 2 begins the more detailed analysis of the palm oil industry. A descriptive survey of historical beginnings, modern data availability and distribution of holdings is followed by a more nuanced analysis of industry-induced ‘myths’ and political ‘enablers’ through the Uribe years (2002–10) and the Santos era (2010–2018). In Part 3 the evidence for ‘stolen land’ is examined in representative oil palm locations.

In other words, the climatic change and environmental degradation act as a “stressor” in different forms of violence in this commodity-based economy recovering from more than 50 years of internal armed conflict. The qualitative approach is based on semi-structured interviews with government representatives and academics to track different perspectives. It is argued that key environmental and climate-related issues in new forms of conflict after the peace deal are linked to the fragmentary distribution and control of land, the ongoing forced migration patterns, and expansion of a new and more lucrative illicit economy. © © 2020, IGI Global.

At the same time, this framing also encapsulates the work of building postconflict Colombia in a physical sense. Focusing on a nationwide process of development aimed at laying the infrastructural foundations of “the Colombia of the future,” this article examines the expectations attached to the built environment at this critical conjuncture. Taking inspiration from a felicitous phrase coined by the Ministry of Transport’s Twitter account, #PazEnConcreto, it highlights the real-and-imaginary work of building a “concrete peace” through the construction of roads, airports, and bridges. By analyzing infrastructure projects expected to mediate the transition to a new stage of history, the first objective is to examine the cultural, political, and economic logics according to which Colombia’s future has been imagined and built. The second objective is to consider what this case suggests about the political agency of the material world in the domain of violence, peace, and security.

At the same time, the country was marked by steady economic growth, above the Latin American average. In addi-tion, much of the political debate took place within and among the institutions of Colombian state and society, illustrating growing state capacity and a mature civil society.

Recognising the uneven distribution and experiences of violence across Colombia, territorial peace seeks to achieve peace and reconciliation through more inclusive citizenship and new forms of territorial development, including bottom up aspirations. Figuring prominently in official policies, the concept of territorial peace is being put to the test of implementation across regions and economic sectors. Building on studies of ‘extractive territories’ emphasising the emergence of territorial subjects and governable spaces of mineral extraction, we examine the case of gold mining, which saw a massive boom and numerous conflicts taking place around the time of peace negotiations and post-agreement transition. Whereas territorial peace called for a bottom-up and participatory approach resting on local communities and artisanal mining livelihoods, we find that the state turned to a top-down governance strategy mobilising alienating forms of formalisation, criminalisation and industrialisation. By exacerbating community marginalisation, social tensions, human rights abuses, and inequalities, we suggest that this strategy not only undermined some of the principles of a territorial peace, but risked perpetuating poverty, environmental degradation and various forms of violence. © 2020, © 2020 King’s College London.","Colombia; gold; resources; territorial peace; Violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084071217"

In doing so, it traces landscape transformations of deforestation and possibilities for making landscapes livable in the midst of disturbance. Drawing on field research, including interviews and participant observation carried out in Colombia from 2016 to 2018, it reveals how deforestation is driven by ongoing colonization and land grabbing, mostly dedicated to extensive cattle ranching, coca cultivation, and campesinos’ transition to ‘licit’ agricultural alternatives. The article also shows how emerging coordination among farmers and forests following forest disturbance contributes to an interpretation of peace in which forests are integral.

Governments seeking to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by protecting and restoring forests are partnering with companies motivated to eliminate deforestation from supply chains. The proliferation of zero-deforestation initiatives is creating opportunities for policy synergies and scaling up impacts, but has led to a more complex regulatory landscape. Drawing on policy analysis and expert interviews, we explore public-private policy interactions in Colombia as a case study for tropical forested nations with interest in aligning climate, forest, and development goals. We consider how zero-deforestation priorities are set on the national agenda and scaled up through public-private partnerships. We identify zero-deforestation initiatives in three overlapping governance domains—domestic public policy, REDD+, sustainable supply chain initiatives—and highlight ten multi-stakeholder pledges that have catalyzed supporting initiatives at multiple scales. Emerging from decades of armed conflict, Colombia is pursuing a peace building model based on low-emissions rural development. The peace deal provided a focusing event for zero-deforestation that converged with political momentum and institutional capacity to open a policy window. A government pledge to eliminate deforestation in the Colombian Amazon by 2020 set the national agenda and stimulated international REDD+ cooperation. Lessons from Colombia show that governments provide important directionality among the proliferation of zero-deforestation initiatives. Public pledges and the orchestration of actors through public-private partnerships allow governments to scale up efforts by aligning transnational activities with national priorities. The case of Colombia serves as a potential zero-deforestation model for other nations, but challenges around equitable land tenure, illegality, and enforcement must be overcome for multi-stakeholder initiatives to produce long-term change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agenda setting; Global forest governance; Low-emissions rural development; Post-conflict; REDD+; Sustainable supply chains","deforestation; emission control; environmental policy; global change; governance approach; government; greenhouse gas; law enforcement; policy analysis; public-private partnership; rural development; scale effect; stakeholder; supply chain management; Amazonas [Colombia]; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081572085"

The effect of conflict on deforestation is thus an empirical question. This paper studies the effect on forest cover of Colombia's recent peace negotiation between the government and the FARC insurgency. Using yearly deforestation data from satellite images and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we show that areas controlled by FARC prior to the declaration of a permanent ceasefire experienced a differential increase in deforestation after the start of the ceasefire. The deforestation effect of peace is attenuated in municipalities with higher state presence and judicial capacity, and is exacerbated by land intensive economic activities.

However, even after an armed conflict has formally ended, natural resources can be an important trigger for a relapse into armed conflict. For these reasons, it is of the utmost importance, both from a security and a development perspective, to address natural resources as an integral part of the peace process. This article aims to assess how provisions in peace agreements addressing natural resource governance are embedded in the international legal framework. It inquires into the particularities and legal nature of peace agreements and examines the various functions of natural resource arrangements as part of peace agreements. Finally, as each category of natural resources comes with distinct legal questions and peacebuilding challenges, the article zooms in on water governance as a case study to explore the different ways in which natural resource arrangements in peace agreements and international law interact.

Responding to this situation, national security policies often identify core threats primarily from a state perspective, disregarding local community perceptions of threat and insecurity. This paper is based on interviews conducted in Colombia with members of three rural communities that have undergone and still suffer from different forms of post-accord violence. Differentiating between measurable and lived security threats, it identifies the communities’ perceptions of threats to their current security situation and compares them to those of the state security actors stationed in the communities. Embedded in the call for more pragmatic, bottom-up peacebuilding, we argue that security is context-specific and stress the importance of understanding the diversity of local community perspectives on security for building sustainable peace under conditions of ongoing violence. Final policy recommendations thus underline the need for a more differentiated approach towards improving security levels that meets the specific threat perceptions and security concerns of local communities and improves cooperation between the communities and state security actors to bring sustainable, localized peace to context-specific security environments. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The Amazon Vision programme, launched by the Colombian government in 2016, seeks to contribute to forest conservation, climate mitigation, poverty reduction and peace building. The Amazon Vision fundamentally reframes the Colombian Amazon from a 'narco frontier' that needs to be liberated from guerrilla influence, organized crime and peasants destroying forests for coca cultivation, to a net CO<inf>2</inf> sink with enormous potential for green growth and poverty reduction. Drawing on historical and empirical qualitative research in Guaviare and complemented by a quantitative land cover classification, this article builds on the concept of 'green territoriality' to investigate the extent to which the shift towards conservation affects property rights and the ability of indigenous groups and peasants to access land and natural resources. We illustrate how the reframing of peasants from protagonists of development and frontier expansion to villains, and of indigenous communities from 'underdeveloped' forest dwellers to environmental guardians, has created land conflicts and affected the legitimacy of their respective property rights. In both cases, the Amazon Vision strengthens conservation policies and challenges existing land rights but also creates new windows of opportunity for the land claims of indigenous communities while reinforcing conceptualizations of social differentiation among dwellers of the Amazon. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

It is critical to understand how government agencies, NGOs, and academics perceive these challenges, as they all contribute to fundamental decision-making on environmental issues. To achieve this objective we formulated fifty-two research questions that were edited, evaluated, and prioritized by members of each group in a dedicated workshop. Ten of these questions were identified as top priorities and shared with twenty additional members of each group. Perceptions and rankings of the ten priority questions were then compared among groups, but no statistical difference was found. These results highlight that broadly similar goals for biodiversity conservation are shared by all key decision makers in post-conflict Colombia. Namely, conservation through sustainable management practices and development of local economies previously affected by the conflict.

However, the change of power structures also contains risks, like the deterioration of natural resources and the strengthening of other armed groups. By addressing collective perceptions regarding the Integrated Rural Reform (IRR), this paper shows the consequences of the peace agreement for the rural population in the department of Caqueta. Additionally, it presents the main challenges for further departmental development. The case study approach uses both semi-structured expert interviews of rural development stakeholders in different sectors based on three sampling strands, as well as participatory observation in the field. The main findings show an increase of general physical security and (economic) interest in the department since the signing of the agreement, while the deforestation rate, homicides, and threats against social-environmental leaders were all highly increased. The study also derives recommendations of departmental actors in rural development for a more effective peace implementation process, like the change from cattle driven to a more conservational economy with agri-silviculture and ecotourism, led by local civil society. To create a stable peace, it is crucial that the current government effectively implements the IRR, while also considering departmental perceptions of sustainable development. If the implementation process and departmental recognition is not enforced sufficiently, then peace might only be possible at the cost of the Amazon and its nature. © 2020 by the authors.","Caquetá; Colombia; Environmental peacebuilding; Natural resource management; Peace agreement; Peacebuilding; Rural development","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080967486"

In situations where agricultural expansion is inevitable, it is important to manage intact landscape transformation so that impacts on environmental values are minimised. Here, we present a novel, spatially explicit, land use planning framework that addresses the decision making needed to account for different, competing economic-environment objectives (agricultural production value, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service retention) when land use change is inevitable within an intact landscape. We apply our framework to the globally significant savannahs of the Orinoquia (Colombia), which in a post-conflict era is under increased agricultural development pressure. We show that while negative environmental impacts can be reduced through planning, the total area of land converted to agriculture is the unavoidable principal driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. We therefore identify planning solutions that perform well across all objectives simultaneously, despite trade-offs among them. When 15%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the study area is allowed to be converted to agriculture, on average planning can improve species persistence and ecosystem service retention by up to 16%, 15%, 12%, and 9%, respectively, when compared to agricultural-focused solutions. Development in the region so far has had an unnecessarily large impact on environmental objectives due to a lack of effective land use planning, creating an 'opportunity debt'. Our study provides an evidence base to inform proactive planning and the development of environmentally sensible agricultural development policy and practice in the region. This framework can be used by stakeholders to achieve agriculture expansion goals and maximise economic profit while minimising impacts on the environment in the Orinoquia, or any relatively intact region that is being developed. © 2020 The Author(s).

The effect of conflict on deforestation is thus an empirical question. This paper studies the effect on forest cover of Colombia’s recent peace negotiation between the central government and the FARC insurgency. Using yearly deforestation data from satellite images and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we show that areas controlled by FARC prior to the declaration of a permanent ceasefire that ultimately led to a peace agreement experienced a differential increase in deforestation after the start of the ceasefire. The deforestation effect of peace is attenuated in municipalities with higher state capacity, and is exacerbated by land intensive economic activities. Our results highlight the importance of complementing peacemaking milestones with state building efforts to avoid environmental damage. © 2020, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

The research revealed that, after the signing of the peace treaty, tourism in previously conflict-affected regions significantly increased due to the growth of privately owned tourism enterprises focused on profit making.

These peasants occupied the region through a long process of colonization and ended up being involved in the dynamics of coca growing and the armed conflict. However, when some rural inhabitants of the departmental capital, San José del Guaviare, were asked what they expected from the ensuing peace building, some uncertainty was perceived regarding their possibilities of remaining in the territory, given the lack of productive alternatives and the overlapping of management structures such as the Amazon Forest Reserve, the Nukak Indigenous Reservation and the Peasant Reserve Zone. To reveal the current situation of the peasants of Guaviare, in addition to the documentary research, which provided a better understanding of the processes of peasant colonization of the forest environment, the ethnographic fieldwork, carried out during three short stays in six villages and in a former Territorial Space for Training and Reincorporation (TSTR), made it possible to understand the different realities of the rural territory, through informal conversations, open interviews, and workshops involving the community. The results of the research reveal that the inhabitants who, decades ago, settled in the rural area of San José del Guaviare, including the former FARC combatants, are peasants who wish to live in peace, despite the historical difficulties associated with its occupation. To be able to do so, the formalization of land tenure and rural productivity must be guaranteed. The contribution of this article lies in the fact that it manages to unveil the territorial memory associated with coca and the conflict, in part of the Colombian Amazon, based on the voices of peasants and ex-combatants, who share a territory that they recognize as their own, and the problems involved in peace building. © 2020, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

Colombia is emerging from an internal conflict that lasted more than 50 years. In this process rural land-use is being transformed, generating new conflicts over land use and control with detrimental effects on Colombia's forests. Based on official documents, reports, existing scholarly work, interviews and observations collected during fieldwork in the Colombian Amazon, I analyze the ways in which peace-building and post-conflict transition have precipitated factors which have aggravated land conflicts and led to the escalation of deforestation in Colombia. I argue that Colombia's current REDD+ efforts mainly serve to attract international funding and legitimize the status quo since they remain disconnected from the structural processes that directly and indirectly drive deforestation. As such, REDD+ in Colombia contributes to a contradictory neoliberal approach to development, which promises to safeguard the environment, while supporting large-scale extractive industries, mining, cattle ranching and intensive agriculture, resulting in the increase in deforestation and forest degradation. © 2020 University of Arizona Libraries.","Colombia; Deforestation; Extractivism; Peace-building; Post-conflict; REDD+","deforestation; environmental degradation; fieldwork; forest management; governance approach; intensive agriculture; peacekeeping; Colombia; Bos","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086841100"

In the case of the rural population, the impact of geopolitical phenomena such as land grabbing and dispossession of lands and territories is a determinant of their health-disease processes. Throughout this article of theoretical reflection, a series of approaches and categories proposed by Jaime Breilh, who has pioneered the subject, is presented and their potential to explain the incidence of these phenomena in the modification of ways of live and the health situation of the rural population. Development: Some substantial components of critical epidemiology in relation to their theoretical and methodological relevance to analyze land dispossession and health processes are the presence of the social in epidemiology; the procedural and spatial-temporal dimension; the macro and the micro: unity and hierarchy; protective and destructive health processes, and the concept of society-nature metabo-lism. Conclusions: The dispossession of land in Colombia has been of great magnitude, and its resolution is considered a central issue for the construction of post-conflict peace. From the theoretical framework of critical epidemiology, it is possible to carry out research to address the incidence of dispossession and the grabbing of lands and territories, in the collective health situation of the rural population. This type of approach has had little development in the country and becomes important in the current context, where growing extractivism threatens the vital processes of agrarian communities. © 2020, Universidad del Rosario.

Following the signing of peace accords with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People’s Army (FARC-EP), what are Colombia’s risks in terms of youth gangs? To assess these risks, this article draws from gang research and literature on post-war violence to identify six factors that recur in post-war environments and are likely to fuel a rise in gangs: illicit economies and criminal networks, exposure to violence, marginalization, social disorganization, security gaps and state responses, and former combatants. After analyzing Colombia’s risks with reference to each of these, the article concludes that the strengthening ties between youth gangs and Colombia’s illicit economies, mediated by adult-run criminal networks, increase gang numbers and violence. Moreover, some disadvantaged, urban neighborhoods are vulnerable to gang escalation due to the effects on local youths of protracted violent exposure, marginalization, and social disorganization. Finally, while ex-combatant recidivism and security gaps are prominent concerns in Colombia, they are not expected to contribute significantly to youth gang dynamics in urban areas. © 2020 The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084233240"

Due to a compromise between the struggling parties, on the one hand, and effective mediation by international community, on the other, the internal armed conflict ended with a peace treaty signed by both forces: government and left radical guerilla. During referendum, a majority of participants did not support peace agreement. In the context of a “right drift”, I. Duque, the supporter of a tougher policy towards former partisans, came to power. However, later, under pressure from international community and internal opposition, the President has taken a more cautious stance. Representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have occupied a number of seats in parliament; government does in general fulfill its financial obligations towards integrating the demobilized fighters into peaceful life, but it has failed to implement sound structural reforms. Former partisans are particularly concerned about growing attempts to revise conditions of transitional justice while the government is unable to offer them an adequate level of personal security. As a result, some dissident groups and their leaders have resumed hostilities, the guevarist (associated with the strategy of Ernesto „Che” Guevara) National Liberation Army (ELN) has also continued terrorist acts. Nevertheless, the renewal of a full-scale conflict is unlikely due to powerful security forces, small number and fragmentation of partisan units operating in some remote areas, their weak coordination and a rivalry between the FARC and the ELN. Despite relatively favorable economic situation, the President has attempted to unleash the unpopular measure of tax increase. Other challenges are student strikes demanding a reform of higher education, continuous drug trafficking, high level of violence and corruption, and the presence of more than a million of Venezuelan refugees on the Colombian land. According to the author’s conclusion, amid such extreme political polarization, unresolved social problems and high level of organized crime, definitive stabilization in Colombia is an extremely complicated matter. However, the country’s unconventional experience in overcoming acute armed confrontation may be useful to unblock protracted conflicts in other regions of the world. © 2020, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The agreement incorporated three changes to institutions governing forest land occupation and use: (a) the demobilization of FARC from forested places, (2) the future distribution of legal land titles and new road construction into forests, and (3) the eradication of illicit crops. However, we document unprecedented rates of forest disturbance in the months following the peace agreement in biodiversity hotspots across the country. Are the declaration of peace and the increased rates of forest disturbance related? Here, we present the first systematic assessment of the impact of the Colombian peace agreement on forest disturbance. Focusing on the Andes-Amazon Transition Belt (AATB), we used automated satellite image disturbance detection methods and ethnographic data to quantify and interpret forest cover change from 2010 to 2018 that span wartime, peace negotiation, and post-peace agreement stages. Our findings indicate that during the post-peace agreement period (2017-2018), the area of forest disturbance increased by 50% (about 238 000 ha) across the AATB in comparison with the four-year peace negotiation stage (2013-2016); these changes reflect the end of FARC-led gunpoint conservation in the region. Forest disturbance also spread deeper into the Amazon watershed and increased in area by 187% within the AATB's protected areas. We find that following the peace agreement and the withdrawal of FARC, key actors (viz. drug cartels, large landowners, campesinos and dissidents) with expectations of favorable land tenure policies swept into the region; this led to increases in large-scale cattle ranching, coca cultivation dispersal, and speculative illegal land markets each of which contributed to the widespread forest disturbance that we mapped. The rapid increase in forest disturbance occurred despite the interest of the international community in promoting forest conservation initiatives in the AATB and Colombia's existing conservation and land titling frameworks for public lands. Our findings underscore the need for conservation strategies sensitive to rapid institutional and demographic changes in the course of the peace agreement to prevent forests from becoming an unexpected casualty of premature and unstable peace. © 2020 The Author(s).

In view of the current land restitution plan the trend of the environmental degradation is most likely to increase due to a higher demand of natural resources caused by the returning population that was displaced during the conflict. With the objective to develop a simple and quick method to diagnose the inefficient and environmentally unsustainable consumption and management of resources for domestic and agricultural purposes from households in that region, the most inclusive method is approached supported by a literature review. As a result, the indicator-based assessment tool pro.eraa was developed with the help of the reference certification tool Green Villages by IGBC of India, the Technical Advice by the One Planet Development of Wales, the local NBA as guidelines and the SDI's of the SDGs. Pro.eraa consists of a total of 51 indicators in the four resource themes: water, energy, waste and activity. The fourth resource ""Activity"" was necessary to be added during the process due to the agricultural context of the region. Pro.eraa was validated and pre-tested on two sites (Huamanga and Chalan) in Montes de Maria. The tool serves as a decision-aid tool to support the selection of tailored and effective interventions that benefits efficiency and environmental sustainability in regard to the human well-being of the rural population as well as the local biodiversity. Apart from the design and validation process, the work includes a showcase application and evaluation of a site and instructions for implementation. During the literature review, it was particularly noted that the current state of the art literature lacks adequate indicator-based assessment or certification tools that lay the focus on sustainable rural development. © 2020 WITPress.

In the 2016 accord, the parties agreed to a laconic process of formalization of private property by assigning property titles to those who already possess land. Restitution and reparations to those deprived of their lands during the 25 years of war were also approved, but the redistribution of property was deferred once again. This issue is especially important, given that Colombia’s Gini coefficient for land distribution is 0.8 %, one of the most unequal in the world. Bearing this in mind, the article discusses the fact that in Colombia, land issues continue to be characterized by a permanent process of originary accumulation, with large estates as the dominant form, and argues that the peace agreement is merely a way of preparing the Colombian agrarian world for full-fledged capitalism, creating property rights necessary for agro-industry and transforming peasants into a work force available for production now that they have been liberated from war. © 2020 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The Red List index (RLI) reflects changes in aggregate extinction risk for sets of species over time (a value of zero means that all species are extinct, a value of one means that all species are categorized as Least Concern). We calculated the first national RLI for birds in Colombia for the period 2002–2016, and disaggregated indices by ecosystems, regions, and species groups. Overall, the status of birds in Colombia has moderately deteriorated during 2002–2016, declining by 0.0000714% per year (the global RLI for birds declined by 0.0297% per year). High Andean forest, paramo, and freshwater are the ecosystems in worst condition. The two regions with the greatest avian diversity contrasted: the Andes has the lowest RLI, and the Amazon the highest. Among species groups, gamebirds, parrots, large frugivores, and forest raptors are the most threatened. Habitat loss from expansion of illicit crops and population declines from hunting were the most important threats. Agricultural expansion, invasive alien animal species, illegal logging and illegal mining are significant threats for some species. Tracking species’ extinction risk is important in a country with the highest bird species richness in the world, dynamic spatial patterns of habitat loss, and high levels of endemism. Recent developments provide reasons for both hope and despair. In 2016, a peace agreement ended 50 years of armed conflict. New opportunities for biodiversity conservation, local development based on bird-watching tourism, and advancement in scientific knowledge of birds now occur alongside dramatic increases in deforestation. These new conservation opportunities and challenges provide strong motivation to take advantage of the fact that the overall risk of extinction of birds in Colombia is still relatively low and stable. Effective action is urgently needed while there still is the opportunity to prevent extinctions and safeguard species, particularly those in higher risk categories. © 2020 Renjifo et al.

Indicators such as national electrification rates can mask significant inadequacies in supply, while delivering electricity for last-mile communities involves particular challenges. This paper presents a timely and important contribution by employing a novel mixed methods approach to understand the process and impacts of electrification in Chocó, a ‘forgotten space’ within Colombia. Chocó is a densely forested, post-conflict region that is characterised by low socio-economic indicators. The paper examines the extent to which the benefits of electricity access have been realised for five villages in the municipality of Bahia Solano. A longitudinal study including surveys, interviews and a classification of households with the World Bank's Multi-Tier Framework provides insights into household energy use, expenditure and outcomes of the electrification process. Using these findings to define future demand scenarios, an energy system optimisation model was used to design a renewable micro-grid for the study villages revealing that distributed renewable energy systems can provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to grid extension. The research shows that the benefits of electrification cannot be assumed, particularly where programmes have a narrow focus on energy infrastructure alone. The delivery of electricity access is not a one-step intervention. It must involve ongoing engagement and consider the social, environmental, economic and political contexts in which people live. Only through this more grounded approach will the benefits of energy for sustainable development be realised. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Colombia; Energy access; Energy system optimisation model; Micro-grid; Multi-Tier Framework; Social research methods","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072568391"

The procedure followed provides a quantitative model where a minimum number of socio-economic and political variables explain the variation in land cover. The results represent the relationship between land use intensity and the main socio-economic and political indicators, highlighting a close interaction between landscape configuration, socio-economic structure of local populations, coercive conservation and armed conflict. A simulated post-conflict landscape shows a clear transition gradient towards agrarian expansion and intensification, also in systems where naturalness is a relevant feature. The peace process in Colombia offers opportunities for new schemes of land planning and management, including natural resource governance and policy reforms to improve welfare and resilience of local communities.

Globally, there is a vibrant academic debate about how to characterize the current rise of right-wing populism or authoritarianism, but more profound insights from each country's situation and its political economy implications are needed. The victory in Colombia was due to numerous factors, including the support from some rural elites who have historically obstructed the enforcement of redistributive land policies. However, the populist aspirations of the right-wing government have been persistently frustrated not only by social unrest and political mobilization but also because of the enforcement of institutions previously incorporated into the country's political scenario. Specifically, in terms of agrarian political economy, two sets of human rights-oriented institutional changes are relevant regarding this matter: (a) the Land Restitution Law enacted in 2011 and (b) the Comprehensive Rural Reform contained in the Agrarian Chapter of the Peace Agreement between the national government and the FARC-EP in 2016. The purpose of this paper is to ground the ongoing theoretical and political debate about the rise of different forms of populism and right-wing authoritarianism in the current Colombian political context, and its implications on the countryside. The analytical contribution of this paper is twofold: On the one hand, I propose an alternative for explaining the nature of the current political regime in Colombia as right-wing authoritarianism; on the other hand, I analyze some features of such regimes in terms of its disputes with the enforcement of human rights-oriented institutions, that are in force as the result of political processes triggered by peasants' mobilization. © 2019 by the authors.","Agrarian policies; Authoritarianism; Colombia; Human rights; Institutional change; Land restitution; Peace agreement; Populism; Rural politics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071234320"

Spatial and statistical analyzes where used to study the landcover change in and around LRP areas at the national and regional level. An index of naturalness using a multi-criteria framework was used to identify important areas for conservation. Within areas, forest cover changes, resulting from deforestation and regeneration processes, decreased between 1990 and 2017. A total of 9.4% of their area show high naturalness, while 20% of them show high importance for conservation.

The department of Norte de Santander has cocoa crops that are dramatically affected by fungal pathogens causing important losses during harvest and post-harvest. Therefore, the current study focused on the determination of the incidence of diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi in cocoa crops, and the identification of primary phytopathogenic fungi found in biological material from different farms of the region. The study was conducted in four municipalities of the department, by sampling fruits infected with frosty pod rot (FPR) and black pod rot (BPR) that presented in situ incidence ranging from 0.37 to 21.58% and from 1.75 to 35.59%, respectively. The studied hybrid materials, together with clone TSH 65, were found to be the most susceptible, while the remaining clones were more tolerant, especially CCN 51, IMC 67, and ICS95.

This article uses the concept of “forensic infrastructures” to examine the symbolic and political importance of the destruction and reconstruction of Danticas. It draws on Eyal Weizman's interpretation of forensics as the art and science of understanding materials as evidence and forums where truth is debated and crafted. It examines the political utility a forensic understanding of infrastructure offers in assessing responsibility for destruction in the aftermath of war. It suggests that performance, physicality, and play—when seen forensically as forums for truth creation—can help achieve embodied forms of justice and reparation after war.

Our paper describes the principles of community-based tourism is, and how it is articulated in the country as the leading pathway to effective and sustainable rural development. It is analyzed in a process where the social dynamics of the Colombian post-conflict are being modified. For this, a literature review is made about three basic aspects, community-based tourism, Phoenix tourism, and rural development. In order to understand this dynamic, a case study was conducted in a rural community in the Sumapaz Páramo, and through a touristic orator, we can make a dialogue with the community, with the purpose of understanding the activities carried out by tourists in rural communities. Phoenix tourism can be a tool to make catharsis and restructure society and the memory of the country. For this to be achieved, the government must contribute to the development of these initiatives.

Although the industry has developed many processes and technologies to minimize waste generation and to dispose them safely and economically, a significant volume of solid waste from oil and gas drilling is expected in the future. For that reason, it is necessary to study some waste reuse alternatives. In this work, the potential use of ashes derived from oil drilling cuts (ODC), applied to tertiary roads construction for remote areas in Colombia, is evaluated. To that purpose, ashes exposed to mechanical heat treatment are used as an improvement agent for lateritic clayey soils of low plasticity, predominant in the eastern region of Colombia (extended to Brasil and Venezuela). This region was selected due to its complexity: it has limited resources and large difficulties to obtain suitable materials for road construction, it is exposed to extreme cycles of drought and flood with an 8-month rainy season, and this is one of the areas to be recovered after peace agreements in the country with the guerrilla. In the experimental plan, basic characterization tests were conducted to the soil, the ash, and mixtures soil-ash, as well as strength and durability evaluation of compacted and cured samples of stabilized soil at 0, 7 and 14 days, considering typical climate conditions of temperature and humidity in the region. Based on successful previous experiences, combination with other nonconventional soil stabilizers, such as salts and waterproofing materials, are also been considered to improve some properties of ash cuttings - soil mixtures. As a result, an economical and viable option is obtained to reduce environmental impacts of wastes and to improve lateritic soils of low mechanical characteristics for road earthworks. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Lateritic soils; Oil drill cuttings; Soil improvement; Waste reuse","Durability; Environmental impact; Heat treatment; Infill drilling; Mixtures; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Population statistics; Road construction; Roads and streets; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Waterproofing; Characterization tests; Durability evaluation; Experimental plans; Industrial development; Mechanical characteristics; Population growth; Temperature and humidities; Waterproofing materials; Soil testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101585479"

Corporate interests in Colombia’s natural resources predated the demobilisation. However, extractive processes were restricted by the dynamics of the armed conflict. In 2016, immediately following the demobilisation, deforestation in Colombia jumped 44 per cent. In the transitional demobilisation period, huge swaths of the country were opened for economic development. Thus, while the environment is often a victim in armed conflict, in Colombia, conflict contributed to the preservation of some areas.

To this end, the research identifies and analyses different manifestations that took place during the process (2002-2016); understands KM and intellectual capital (IC) from a heterodox perspective; highlights the KM and IC impact on the organisational field of the public domain; recognises KM and IC as differential factors of the political, legal, economic, and media framework of the peace dialogues and agreements; and shows KM and IC as an innovative and substantial aspect of the development and success of the process. The focus is not placed on evaluating the hits and misses of the PA, but on identifying and discussing further the KM techniques and tools used, given the accumulation of content and knowledge generated. Using an analytical method and a dialectical methodology of contrasting multidisciplinary and multi-institutional arguments, the study proposes a differential hermeneutics and an exegesis of what is intangible in the process by identifying, describing, and analysing the information collected, the tools, the methods, and the KM strategies applied in the process. Thus, this work presents a summary of the sociohistorical context of the Colombian conflict, the chronology and rhetoric of the peace process, and the management of the oral, written, and audiovisual material produced, as well as the IC acquired by the different active actors that have been present in the different stages of this process. This paper also presents the KM tensions, challenges, and opportunities in the Colombian social unfolding to tackle an unknown environment with supranational interests that demand peace and an inevitable commitment to the new generations. Finally, the current impacts of this KM approach are emphasised, in search of the theoretical and practical bases that favour the establishment of structures and/or models to be replicated in other latitudes. © 2019 Academic Conferences Limited.

For instance, mangroves are extensive along the Pacific coast due to both high annual rainfall rates and the presence of many world-class deltas. Besides, they are the habitat of the only Neotropical endemic mangrove (Pelliciera rhizophorae), which is also a threatened species. In contrast, mangroves are discontinuously distributed along the Caribbean coast and they are extensive in the three major deltas and a few coastal lagoons. In addition, dwarf and stunt mangroves are found in northern arid lands sprung by seasonal streams and rivers. Recent studies have highlighted the global significance of the Colombian mangroves in terms of their extension, low deforestation rates (particularly in the Pacific coast), and high reservoirs of ecosystem carbon scattered nation-wide. Nonetheless, most of the current understanding of the biogeography of our mangroves has been obtained by integrating studies independently conducted in different sites and years. The voluminous information collected by Heliodoro Sánchez-Páez and his colleagues in the largest national inventory of mangroves (MCP: Mangroves of Colombia Project, Ministry of the Environment) undertaken in the mid 1990's provides an opportunity to re-assess biogeographic hypotheses (e.g., that high rainfall promotes the increase in the importance value of red mangroves) and to explore macroecological patterns when combined with open data sets. The objective of this paper was to introduce HELIO_SP.CO v.1, an open database derived from this mangrove inventory as a homage to Heliodoro Sánchez-Páez, who passed away in 2017, as a platform for macroecological studies and benchmark for future impact assessments of climate change and land-use change on mangroves in Colombia. In addition, the contributions of the MCP were reviewed and the general geographic patterns were explored by using HELIO_SP.CO v.1. For instance, the shift of the two dominant mangrove species in Colombia across the rainfall gradient observed from Nariño to La Guajira was clearly depicted. Using WorldClim 2, we also explored the rainfall and temperature spaces where the species occur. Finally, we briefly reviewed the progress of mangrove science since 1997 and identified some challenges regarding climate change and post-armed conflict scenarios in Colombia. © 2018 Revista de la Academia Colombiana de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales.All right reserved.","Avicennia germinans; Biogeography; Climatic space; HELIO_SP.CO v.1; Laguncularia racemosa; Macroecology; Pelliciera rhizophorae; Post-conflict; Rhizophora spp","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064241408"

This article refers to examples of women’s engagement in combat to challenge some of the reasons given for women’s marginalisation, including reference to women’s skillset, aptitude and interests. The article adopts a feminist institutionalist approach to show how SSR helps security sector institutions construct and reconstruct gender power relations, reinforce gendered dynamics of exclusion, and determine gendered outcomes. It concludes by drawing attention to the transformational potential of SSR to alter gender power relations, and thereby enhance the security of women and the sustainability of peacebuilding efforts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Defence sector reform; female combatants; gender; peacebuilding; security sector reform","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055120611"

Colombia, emerging from decades of war between the Colombian government and the FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), is experiencing an urgent need to allocate financial resources to large-scale projects with the aim of supporting post-conflict development activities, potentially resulting in rapid and hyper-development conditions and causing severe environmental impacts. Theoretically, SEA can be seen as one way to assist the Colombian government in their strategic decision-making and planning. However, the use of SEA will be bound by the post-conflict conditions and the more general institutional setting in Colombia. This article is focused on identifying the opportunities and challenges arising from the post-conflict context and the SEA action arena in Colombia. By doing this, the article provides a better understanding of institutional processes and resources in Colombia and contributes to the limited scholarly literature that is available on the application of SEA in post-conflict contexts, including research on the institutional capacity involved. © 2018","Colombia; Institutions; Post-conflict; Strategic environmental assessment","Decision making; Environmental impact assessments; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Colombia; Institutional capacities; Institutional process; Institutional setting; Post-conflict; Strategic decision making; Strategic environmental assessments; Sustainability transition; Environmental impact; decision making; environmental planning; government; institutional reform; natural resource; resource allocation; strategic environmental assessment; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054429476"

On the other hand, the processes displacement and refugee's relocation in post-conflict countries have been associated with different environmental impacts. Currently, Colombia faces a post-conflict scenario, which brings about relevant socio-environmental challenges: it is a mega-biodiverse country, it has millions of displaced people and is one of the most inequitable country in the world. Since there is a gap in post-conflict studies regarding the exploration of victims' involvement in environmental strategies, this paper aims to analyze victims' willingness to participate (WP) in Land Recovery Strategies (LRS) in post-conflict Colombia. This research (1) describes the socio-economic characteristics of forced-displacement victims from a Caribbean municipality of Colombia; (2) analyzes the victims' WP in hypothetical LRS and their preferred type of participation in the project, (3) identifies the way of grouping victims according their WP. Finally, (4) it analyzes the kind of benefits victims would prefer to receive in exchange for their participation in the LRS. Our results made evident that the majority of the consulted victims are willing to participate in LRS by giving up manual work time or in exchange of local ecological knowledge. We also found that the victims' participation in LRS associates to the age of the respondents, and whether they have benefited from government programs previously. Victims would prefer monetary retribution in exchange for their involvement in LRS, which may be explained by their vulnerable socioeconomic conditions. This research also demonstrates that victims with positive WP in LRS are a heterogeneous group. We highlight the need of actively involving women in LRS and other post-conflict projects in order to ensure their wellbeing. The results of this research are valuable, because they put forward the population of victims as an active performer within environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation agriculture; Ecosystem services valuation; Land recovery strategies; Post-conflict countries; Victim population; Willingness to donate time","Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Knowledge management; Sustainable development; Colombia; Conservation agricultures; Ecosystem service valuation; Ecosystem services; Land recovery strategy; Post-conflict country; Recovery strategies; Victim population; Willingness to donate; Willingness to donate time; Environmental impact; alternative agriculture; conservation management; ecosystem service; environmental economics; participatory approach; post-war; refugee; socioeconomic status; strategic approach; sustainability; valuation; absenteeism; adult; age; Article; Caribbean; community participation; ecosystem regeneration; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; female; government; human; knowledge; learning; male; manual labor; money; priority journal; reforestation; reward; rural area; socioeconomics; strategic planning; sustainable agriculture; victim; vulnerable population; war; environment; environmental policy; environmental protection; Caribbean Region; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Policy; Humans; Refugees","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049353593"

The right to health in these areas also involves the exercise of power, of dialogue of knowledge, forgiveness, non-re-petition and respect. In addition, health promotion and disease prevention services, treatment and rehabilitation based on the primary care strategy should be offered, that is, they should be adapted to the cultural realities, the environments and the interests of the communities.

We discuss ways in which these transformative events will act in combination to shape the ecological and environmental future of Colombia.

However, further examination of the conceptual entry points for linking efforts for reducing forest-based emissions with those for delivering SDGs is required. This review paper aims to contribute to fulfilling this research need. It provides insights into the links between conserving forests for climate change mitigation and peacebuilding. Specifically, the paper examines opportunities to harness climate finance for conserving forests and achieving long-lasting peace and sustainable food. It does so via a literature review and the examination of the Orinoquia region of Colombia. The findings from the literature review suggest that harnessing climate finance for conserving forests and peacebuilding is, in theory, viable if the activities are designed in accordance with social, institutional, and economic factors. Meanwhile, the Orinoquia region provides evidence that these two seemingly intractable problems are proposed to be solved together. At a time when efforts for reducing forest-based emissions are being designed and targeted at (post-) conflict areas in Colombia and elsewhere, the paper's findings might demonstrate the compatibility of programs aimed at reducing forest-based emissions with efforts relating to peacebuilding and sustainable food to both environmental and non-environmental government agencies. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate finance; Forest conservation; Peacebuilding; REDD+; Sustainable food systems","Conservation; Finance; Forestry; Sustainable development; Tropics; Climate change mitigation; Food system; Forest conservation; Government agencies; Literature reviews; Peacebuilding; REDD; Tropical countries; Climate change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054592458"

Due to land use changes resulting from this new situation, negative effects on biodiversity, including mammals are expected. We think that mammal populations will be more sensitive in municipalities where activities related to post-conflict will be carried out. In that order, we aim to: 1) identify which mammal species would be more sensitive and 2) identify the critical regions where there is higher richness of sensitive mammals. We used the distributions of 95 mammal taxa and calculated a sensitivity index by combining four factors: 1) the proportion of each species distribution within protected areas in relation to their proposed extinction thresholds, 2) the proportion within post-conflict municipalities, 3) the proportion of five types of potential land use in post-conflict municipalities and 4) the threat status of each species. Using this index, we drew a map of species richness for mammals classified at high-risk and very high-risk categories. Primates were the most sensitive group to post-conflict changes. Urabá and the region near to the Serranía de San Lucas were the areas with the highest richness of sensitive species. We suggest using primates as flagship species to carry out conservation schemes in the post-conflict era in programmes led by local farmers and former fighters who have been reintegrated into civilian life. © 2018 Pensoft Publishers.

Yet, the relationships and dependencies of underlying deforestation drivers are not well understood. For an adequate territorial reorganization in the post-conflict era that is sensitive to local context, a targeted analysis of the present situation at the local level is required. This study investigates direct and indirect deforestation drivers, relationships among these and potential measures to lower deforestation post-conflict. The analysis uses spatial data of the Global Forest Watch project as a starting point for semi-structured interviews with 25 locally and regionally engaged stakeholders, triangulated with existing literature on the social, political and economic situation in the region. The results suggest that deforestation is not only caused by uncontrolled land colonization, but also related to the armed conflict, specifically the eradication of illicit crops and waves of migration due to the displacement of communities. Interviewees stressed the ambiguous role of armed groups and the responsibility of the state in incentivizing deforestation through building roads for the oil industry, fostering extractive industries and cattle ranching. The study reveals a high level of uncertainty among stakeholders regarding the possible effects of the peace agreement between the government and the FARC. Interviewees emphasized the crucial role of good governance and state sovereignty when working towards the establishment of alternative profitable industries, the implementation of environmental compensation schemes and an increased investment into environmental education. © 2018 The Authors","Armed conflict; Ecosystem services; Forest protection; Land use; Post-conflict","armed forces; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental education; environmental protection; governance approach; government; land use conflict; peace process; regional planning; stakeholder; territorial planning; Amazonia; Colombia; Bos","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048193701"

This scenario brings many challenges to peacebuilding, mainly in the territories that have been marked by armed conflict. since the second half of 2016, Universidad Nacional de Colombia has been implementing the ""Programa Especial de Admisión y Movilidad Académica (PEAMA)"" which could be translated to ""Special Program of Admission and Academic Mobility"" in Sumapaz, a rural area of 90 kilometers from the urban area of Bogotá, considered a territory historically marked by the armed conflict. The PEAMA programs of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia are offered to the population that lives in areas of difficult access to higher education and/or with problems of public order. Its main objective is to guarantee access to quality higher education in these territories. According to the resolution 405 of 2016 of the Rectory, the program has three stages: an initial phase where admitted students study in their territory for up to four semesters; then students move to one of the campuses of the University to continue their studies and finally return to their territories to implement their degree work. The particular case of the PEAMA Sumapaz is characterized by using Project-Based Learning as a pedagogical strategy, which is key to strengthen academic skills in students as well as a way to formulate proposals that strengthen the missionary functions of the university. The first version of PEAMA Sumapaz involved 30 students divided into five programs: Agricultural Engineering Animal Science, Agricultural Engineering, Nursing, Veterinary Medicine and it is administered by the Faculty of Engineering. In addition, four faculties, professors of different disciplines, tutors, academic coordination and administrative coordination are involved. In these two years of the PEAMA, the impact that the program has brought to the region has not yet been investigated. This article presents the perception of the community about the PEAMA and the impacts under the sustainability framework (cultural, environmental, social, and economic), has had its implementation from the perspective of Humanitarian Engineering. This program exemplifies the efforts of the Faculty of Engineering of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia to help to address and minimize or eradicate the needs and solve the problems of a part of Bogotá's rural society, that is, to recognize the responsibility of engineering in the resolution of social problems in a search of improvement of the quality of life of the communities. Finally, the risks, challenges, and problems evidenced by the community are exposed as well as the opportunities that can be used by the PEAMA in the future. The main results highlight the community's feeling of perceiving the university and the PEAMA program as a key player in the territory, beyond just the academic dimension, the community's interest in increasing the careers offered by the program, also expresses the need for the community to be informed about the projects developed inside the University. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","Community Development; Humanitarian Engineering; Sustainability; Sustainable Human Development","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051190503"

Crop duster planes sprayed a concentrated formula of Monsanto’s herbicide, glyphosate, over illicit crops, and also forests, soils, pastures, livestock, watersheds, subsistence food and human bodies. Given that a national peace agreement was signed in 2016 between FARC-EP guerrillas and the state to end Colombia’s over five decades of war, certain government officials are quick to proclaim aerial fumigation of glyphosate an issue of the past. Rural communities, however, file quejas (complaints or grievances) seeking compensation from the state for the ongoing effects of the destruction of their licit agro-forestry. At the interfaces of feminist science and technology studies and anthropology, this article examines how evidentiary claims are mobilized when war deeply politicizes and moralizes technoscientific knowledge production. By ethnographically tracking the grievances filed by small farmers, I reveal the extent to which evidence circulating in zones of war – tree seedlings, subsistence crops, GPS coordinates and bureaucratic documents – retains (or not) the imprints of violence and toxicity. Given the systematic rejection of compensation claims, farmers engage in everyday material practices that attempt to transform chemically degraded ecologies. These everyday actualizations of justice exist both alongside and outside contestation over the geopolitically backed violence of state law. Rather than simply contrasting everyday acts of justice with denunciatory claims made against the state, farmers’ reparative practices produce an evidentiary ecology that holds the state accountable while also ‘senti-actuando’ (feel-acting) alternative forms of justice. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.","aerial fumigation; evidentiary ecologies; socioecological justice; war on drugs in Colombia","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044527490"

With the aim to provide insights for the current discussion on rural environmental sustainability in today’s post-conflict Colombia, we analyzed the environmental dynamics of seven PCC. We found that (1) deforestation and land use conflicts were frequent impacts in both conflict and post-conflict scenarios, that (2) return of displaced population, the infectiveness of land use planning, and the dependence on the primary sector were frequent drivers of environmental change; and that (3) natural resources extraction tends to be intensified in post-conflict period. We discuss these findings in light of the current environmental problems of Colombia and the post-conflict environmental challenges. We conclude that in order to ensure environmental sustainability in post-conflict scenario, Colombia should act on structural aspects that go beyond the environmental objectives proposed in the peace agreement between the government and FARC: strengthening environmental institutions, integrating long-term environmental objectives across all sectors, and deintensifying the dependence of the economy in the extractive sector. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Armed conflicts; Colombia; Environmental impacts; Environmental sustainability; Natural resources extraction; Post-conflict countries; Social metabolism","environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental restoration; government; land use conflict; land use planning; metabolism; natural resource; prioritization; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; Colombia","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014117559"

In Colombia, where no such research exists so far, the conflict which officially ended in November 2016 has led to massive internal migration due to forced displacement, as well as to widespread degradation of the environment. Based on evidence provided by case studies of top-down and bottom-up living memorials and urban agriculture initiatives, the article explores the potential of urban greening in the process of memorialisation and in generating new social cohesion, as well as better living conditions in urban areas. It analyses cases both where the conflict has taken place and in the cities where refugees have settled, in order to explore avenues for public policies in post conflict Colombia.

However, not many studies have focused on the effects of substituting illicit crops with regards to the concept of rural prosperity. The paper presents a new methodological focus for substituting illicit crops in conflict areas, based on the “Working with People” (WWP) model. It incorporates expert knowledge relating to planning activities for substituting illicit crops, and links between prosperity and rural development. The study is based on a region of Colombia called La Macarena. The social base consists of 2503 families affected by the historic conflict involving illegal armed groups (FARC) for more than 50 years. We present the different phases and historic milestones that have occurred in relation to Alternative Development policies in Colombia (1964–2016). The empirical evidence presented indicates that WWP model provides process of social learning, and can be effective for substituting illicit crops, to alternative development projects by the public and private sectors. Establishing trust by working with people was the main condition, which facilitated the creation of prosperity and rural development with a sustainability vision. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative development; Colombia; Illicit crops; Land governance; Rural prosperity","conceptual framework; crop; knowledge; land management; methodology; policy development; rural development; rural economy; social conflict; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039444193"

These systems had yet to be described in the literature, especially their potential in terms of biodiversity conservation. The systems studied are located in a post-conflict area, and a deforestation front in Colombian Amazonia. Cacao cropping systems are of key importance in Colombia: cacao plays a prime role in post conflict resolution, as cacao is a legal crop to replace illegal crops; cacao agroforests are expected to be a sustainable practice, promoting forest-friendly land use. Material and methods We worked in 50 x 2000 m2 agroforest plots, in Colombian Amazonia. A cluster analysis was used to build a typology based on 28 variables characterised in each plot, and related to diversity, composition, spatial structure and light availability for the cacao trees. We included variables related to light availability to evaluate the amount of transmitted radiation to the cacao trees in each type, and its suitability for cacao ecophysiological development. Main results We identified 4 types of cacao agroforests based on differences concerning tree species diversity and the impact of canopy spatial structure on light availability for the cacao trees in the understorey. We found 127 tree species in the dataset, with some exclusive species in each type. We also found that 3 out of the 4 types identified displayed an erosion of tree species diversity. This reduction in shade tree species may have been linked to the desire to reduce shade, but we also found that all the types described were compatible with good ecophysiological development of the cacao trees. Main conclusions and prospects Cacao agroforest systems may actually be achieving biodiversity conservation goals in Colombian Amazonia. One challenging prospect will be to monitor and encourage the conservation of tree species diversity in cacao agroforest systems during the development of these cropping systems, as a form of forest-friendly management enhancing sustainable peace building in Colombia. © 2018 Suárez Salazar et al.

For this reason, the objective of the point titled ""Toward a New Colombian Countryside: Comprehensive Rural Reform"" is to lay the foundations for the transformation of Colombian rural reality by envisioning policies to promote access to land, incentives for small farmers and communitarian producers, and mechanisms to guarantee the effective enjoyment of social, economic, and cultural rights by rural communities. Nevertheless, there is a long way to go before the Comprehensive Rural Reform actually generates social, economic, and institutional changes that allow for the integration of rural communities and the creation of conditions for the social wellbeing of the rural population. This task entails normative and institutional adjustments at State level, as well as changes in the practices of all actors responsible for making them a reality. The article carries out a documentary revision of research carried out on the concepts of rural development with a territorial approach and new rurality, and analyzes the main aspects of point one of the Agreement, the draft bills and decrees deriving from it, the situation of the agricultural sector institutions in charge of their implementation, and the power correlations among the parties, in order to provide an assessment after a year of implementation. Finally, the paper comes to a conclusion by discussing the legal and political difficulties observed. All of these elements make it possible to say that the first stage of implementation of the Comprehensive Rural Reform has moved forward with great difficulties, encountering institutional resistance and normative obstacles. Nevertheless, this is just the beginning. © 2018","Acuerdo de Paz; agricultural sector institutions; Comprehensive Rural Reform; conflicto armado; implementation normativa; instituciones del sector agropecuario; keyword missing; normative implementation; peace agreement; política pública; proceso de la paz; reforma agraria; Reforma Rural Integral; Reforma Rural Integral","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092757719"

This paper stems from an investigation to characterize the political kidnapping by the FARC in Colombia. Objective. To Develop the profile of the guerrilla who would succeed the legality if the peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC. Materials and methods. It is a descriptive exploratory research based on content analysis, from the reading of seven books whose authors were victims of political kidnapping by the FARC. Results. The guerrilla reaches almost always very young squad, hunger, fear, need or belief; It is inserted in a rigid and vertical organization structure, whose ideology is easily indoctrinated, because almost always come poor, will cove that speech. It fits almost always easy to the jungle, but develops insensitivity to people's lives, even animals. The bosses are authoritarian, whimsical and high interference in everyday decisions of guerrillas and hostages. Conclusions. The guerrilla fighter would return to legality she is young, with low or average academic level, but high level of indoctrination; very resourceful in everyday life; used to obey and logic to support their decisions on arms.; Introdução: O sequestro político é una prática de presão sob o Estado que torna-se recorrente na Colômbia por grupos armados ilegais, particularmente pela FARC.

However, this environmental security polemic is still trying to deliver a well-defined approach to achieving peace. Studies are being undertaken to find the precise pathways by which cooperative actions are expected not only to pre-empt or moderate resource conflicts but also to help diffuse cooperative behaviour to other disputed issues. The recognition that environmental resources can contribute to violent conflict accentuates their potential significance as pathways for cooperation and the consolidation of peace in post-conflict societies. Conceived as a single and reliable reference source which will be a vital resource for students, researchers, and policy makers alike, the Routledge Handbook of Environmental Conflict and Peacebuilding presents a wide range of chapters written by key thinkers in the field, organised into four key parts: Part I: Review of the concept and theories; Part II: Review of thematic approaches (resources, scarcity, intervention, adaptation, and peacebuilding); Part III: Case studies (Middle East, Iraq, Jordan, Liberia, Nepal, Colombia, Philippines); Part IV: Analytical challenges and future-oriented perspectives. Enabling the reader to find a concise expert review on topics that are most likely to arise in the course of conducting research or policy making, this volume presents a truly global overview of the key issues and debates in environmental conflict and peacebuilding. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Ashok Swain and Joakim Øjendal; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050430636"

The main focus is to develop a modular house prototype in the rural area of Toribio Cauca, by using industrial hemp as the main material. This will be used as a strategy for sustainable development of rural communities in the post-conflict period in Colombia. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Consequences of these socio-economic and political changes on ecosystems are largely uncertain, but there is growing concern about derived increases in environmental degradation. Here, we review the capacity of Colombia to monitor the state of its ecosystems and their rate of change over time. We found several important programs currently set in place by different institutions as well as by independent groups of scientists that address different aspects of environmental monitoring. However, most of the current initiatives could be improved in terms of data coverage, quality and access, and could be better articulated among each other. We propose a set of activities that would increase the capacity of Colombia to monitor its ecosystems, provide useful information to policy makers, and facilitate scientific research. These include: 1) the establishment of a national center for ecological synthesis that focuses on analyzing existing information; 2) the establishment of an ecological observatory system that collects new information, integrates remote sensing products, and produces near real-time products on key ecological variables; and 3) the creation of new platforms for dialog and action within existing scientific and policy groups. © 2017 The Authors","Armed conflict; ecological synthesis; ecosystem monitoring; national monitoring system; state transitions","carbon; biodiversity; Colombian; data analysis; ecosystem monitoring; environmental monitoring; information processing; land use; political system; priority journal; remote sensing; Review; scientific literature; socioeconomics; soil; vegetation","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021186014"

This seems common in third world countries. Intelligent Knowledge based systems (IKBS) have to do with the creation of value from intangible intelligent assets, that are resurrected from amalgams of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering (KE), BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING (BPR), Cognitive Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, and Third Millennium organizations, among others. Intelligent behavior requires being able to acquire and manage information, data and knowledge to make effective decisions for organizations to function intelligently in crises. Requires intellectually demanding environments with more open minds. The U. San Jose-FESSANJOSE has developed a supportive environment for decision-making in the complexity of higher education (HE), and a set of planning tools has been designed to deal with the crisis. These tools, are expected to help stakeholders develop and communicate understanding of high priority issues so that smart decisions can be made and implemented during crises in the case of Colombia. After 60 years of war confrontation (civil society, guerrilla, paramilitary) we are preparing toward a post-conflict situation; for labor re-qualification of thousands of victims a new education model based on integrating architectures and knowledge systems is proposed. The post-agreement implies greater social investment especially in education, towards the reconstruction of Peace and Equity that goes beyond social mobility (e.g. employment) with new educational models based on high quality and decentralization. Nowadays the Government of Colombia (GoC) signed an Agreement with the guerilla FARC after 6 years of talks. In the following days the Peace Nobel Prize was granted to the GoC President, Juan M. Santos. The following days new dialogues, with the minor and remaining guerilla ELN, was announced for starting soon in Ecuador. If succeed, the total peace will be warranted. The new educational model, involves: • Individual monitoring and evaluation, • guided by ICT (information and communicationstechnologies), • competencies (supported by KE) • asynchronous methodolyg, • personal tutoring: teaching/automated online (includingmobile devices usage), • for the population of young and adult, victims of armedconflicts, • for people preparation for the IV Industrial Revolution,and to face the transition to the Digital Transformation(to radically improve performance of institutions) Regarding the social situation, in our side we are preparing for a post-conflict situation; we have to prepare thousands of demobilized people and victims, requiring labor re-qualification. In addition, given the deficit of 100,000 ICT Engineers, and 300,000 Technologist (T) and Professional Technicians (PT), e.g. programmers; our proposal is intended as a disruptive innovation to address the post-war digital divide, and this country has based human talent mental rehabilitation, with training and labor requalification. We integrated our own experiences and proposed a new education model, based on the integration into an Intelligent Management Information System (iMIS), of 5 architectures that we previously have implemented in several higher education Institutions (HEI) in Colombia. Those architectures, supported by the convergence of Information, Software, and KE, with Artificial & Computational Intelligence, and guided by mathematical and computational models. iMIS integrates hybrid multilevel architectures with multilevel systems, in order to respond to the solution of HE-ME (middle education) problems, leading to face competitiveness and productivity, observing specifically how to include these technologies for evolving the university into modernity, bringing together the institution governability, the student and teacher productivity, and the High Quality Education (HQE). The paper characterizes an intelligent educational organization of the III millennium, defines post-conflict crises, and discusses a competency-based educational model as part of the alternatives to confront the national crisis with an educational crisis management framework. We are trying to consolidate numerous experiential learnings related to the complexity of HE such as student dropout, educational quality, productivity and competitiveness in an underdeveloped country like Colombia. Finally, the model includes the use of architectural tools already implemented. © 2017 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

That lack has had a major negative impact on lower-income rural families (mainly small farmers and wage earners) by helping to make their land a vulnerable asset, subject to systematic misappropriation of one sort or another. Small farmers have also been victimized by a pervasive policy bias against them. The societal cost of these two historic injustices has taken many forms, most obviously death and displacement, loss of land, food insecurity and loss of income. Absent these injustices, the average income of the agricultural population of small farmers and wage earners would be an estimated two to three times higher than it now is.

The government’s recognition of peasant coca growers (campesino cocaleros) as victims of the conflict is one example of this influence, and another is the cocaleros’ own appropriation of the discourse of reparation to frame their struggle for decriminalization as a demand for recognition by the state as political subjectswith special rights. This demand brings up two points. First, campesino cocaleros consider themselves victims of both the armed conflict and widespread drug trafficking in the rural areas where they live and work. Second, although, unlike Colombia’s indigenous and Afro-descended populations, they share no identifying ethnic identity, they identify as a culturally diverse social and political group, whose rights and survival must be defended based on another defining characteristic: their rootedness on the land. I argue that this defense goes beyond the exercise of the politics of identity to the exercise of the politics of differentiated inclusion, which entails the redefinition of citizenship and the setting up of actions based on principles of interculturality. © 2017 CALACS.","Catatumbo; Citizenship; Coca growers; Cultural rights; Peace negotiations; Politics of inclusion; Putumayo","citizenship; cultural identity; ethnicity; human rights; negotiation process; peace process; peacekeeping; Colombia; Putumayo","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045880763"

Historically, there is evidence of the existence of several controversies among individuals and social groups due to the presence of different ways of thinking, feeling, and expressing their feelings either in politics, in the universities, in the companies or in institutions. There are data about several Colombian newspapers that affirm that the armed conflict in Colombia has left about seven million victims; a shared responsibility of FARC, paramilitary groups, and the Colombian state. Objective. For this reason, the research was intended to analyze the resolution of conflicts in order to promote a peace culture through the intervention of alternate communication media. Its theoretical basis is supported by Fisas (2011), Berganza and Ruiz (2005), and Bello (2008), among others. Materials and methods. Explanatory and analytical method with non-experimental, transversal field design. Informants: two hundred individuals. Instrument with 101 items and five choices of response, validated and subject to reliability. Results. The main findings include the strategic guidelines corresponding to resolution of conflicts to promote a peace culture from the alternate communication, as well as relevant conclusions and recommendations. Conclusions. According to the results of the research, difficulties faced by staff of organizations to use conflict resolution styles; however, according to the analysis of inferential statistics, in a second result the association of the difficulties of some individuals to use an effective communication style and show a proper behavior has been found. Finally, and giving response to the main question of the research, it is understood that the lower the degree of resolution of conflicts employed by leaders the lower the degree of promotion of a peace culture from al alternate communication by the employees. Concerning conflict resolution to promote peace, the environments subject to analysis show a low consideration of the use of alternate communication media.

Findings: The results of the research help to provide a better understanding of the conditions needed to develop and manage sustainable tourism in post-conflict environments. In so doing, it should be possible to make better policy decisions, with particular reference to social and urban interventions on planning, design and entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: The transformation of Medellin’s civic culture can be a model for destination with similar histories that present significant destination image and branding challenges – though each will take different paths.

A post-conflict context would open up the possibility of modernizing agriculture, improving living standards in rural areas and making good use of the vast natural resources. Sustainable bioenergy combined with improved land use strategies is of particular interest in this context. However, while bioenergy is today the second largest renewable resource after hydropower, no official plans exist for exploiting it in a post-conflict context. Our study investigates the impacts that an accelerated deployment of bioenergy could have in Colombia until 2030, under different land use pathways. Firstly, we review the country's socioeconomic, land use, energy and emissions context. Then, we identify lessons that Colombia could learn from Brazil to accomplish the proposed targets. Secondly, we explore various scenarios deploying different technologies (bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, biomethane and biomass-based power generation & CHP) and land use pathways that are likely to be implemented in a post-conflict scenario (zero deforestation, agricultural intensification and extensification). Thirdly, we analyze variations in energy demand and supply, greenhouse gas emissions, land use change and biofuel trade. We find that biomethane and biomass-based power generation & CHP could reduce emissions more effectively than first-generation biofuels. However, their abatement is only 5% relative to a baseline scenario. Combining all bioenergy technologies with zero deforestation, agricultural intensification and extensification could boost abatements up to 280%, a value four times higher than the national commitments by 2030. Our study shows that relatively simpler land use and energy models using free software can produce results of quality comparable to more complex and widely accepted models (e.g. IAMs). These results might be helpful to policymakers evaluating the role of bioenergy in a post-conflict context and to other developing countries with significant bioenergy potential and similar conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural intensification; Bioenergy; Biofuels; Deforestation; Energy modeling; Energy policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use change; Post-conflict","Bioethanol; Biomass; Developing countries; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Agricultural intensification; Bio-energy; Biomethane; Colombia; Energy model; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-use strategies; Landuse change; Post-conflict; Power- generations; Deforestation","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010403663"

Colombia is the first country in Latin America in which these two elements, land and gender, have been explicitly included in the peace process. One of the conclusions of this reflection is that more institutional support is needed for rural women's organizations in order to consolidate the results of a gender-just land restitution and link these to the rural reforms of the peace agenda, as a contribution to a more democratic participation of men and women in post-conflict rural development.","Gender; Justice; Land restitution; Peace process; Women's organizations","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016944941"

In 2012, the Colombian government launched a large-scale social housing program to alleviate the housing deficit caused by conflict and furthermore compensate the IDPs for their losses. The principles of this initiative are in line with the wishes of most victim families, who prefer to stay in the cities to which they moved due to the conflict. The new apartments and houses are provided free of charge and are in high demand. That may help to explain the lack of success of another large-scale reparation program, land restitution, which promotes the return of displaced households to the countryside.Building on empirical qualitative field data, this article shows how the free housing program 'cements' the choice of displaced families to continue living in cities and further develop their post-conflict urban livelihoods and social networks, as opposed to returning to the depopulated rural areas and re-establishing agricultural activities. It is argued that those housing projects are not the ideal solution to the problems of housing shortage and poverty among the displaced population. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Colombia; Housing; Land restitution; Reparations; Social policy; Urbanization","development project; land rights; poverty alleviation; social conflict; social network; social policy; urban housing; urban population; urbanization; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963533176"

Peace brought consolidation to the business. It gave mine owners the ability to control the supply of emeralds that would be let out onto the market. New efficiencies in the production process disrupted older social relations. Miners who had once let emeralds slip through their fingers, now exercised a much tighter control. In the time of the emerald wars, the owners of the mines had to sustain large followings. This meant that they had to be very generous and openhanded with their emeralds, diffusing them through networks of people joined together by kinship, affinity and personal loyalty. The end of the wars brought an end to the need for such followings. Miners could cut out many of the men and women who stood between themselves and the foreign buyers of Colombian stones.

The culture of peace in Colombia is a structural context, according to the UN. This sustainability and research process for peace provides profound social, cultural and human consequences that must be approached from resignification and transformation scenarios and from educative institutions, especially in the higher education, because it influences many realities. Objective. To develop a third-level academic context to strengthen the scientific development in the education field. Results. The consolidation of the advanced academic programs is a way to form and educate a critical mass of teachersand professional who should be able to facilitate environments of social respect and human recognition. Conclusions. Within this scope, academic responses are evidently necessary to properly and pertinently assume the challenges demanded by society, leading the educative mission towards the search for a new human being that makes a difference and for the conflict in its multiplicity of visions, thus having a life opportunity for qualitatively advancing towards new intellectual, familiar, educative, cultural and politic growth scenarios.","Education; Multidiversity of violences; Peace; Pedagogy; Postconflict; War culture","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84984918452"

It is not circumscribed to the “post-conflict” period or the realization of a peace process. It involves both external and local actors in the pursuit of a practical objective, stopping people from being killed and killing each other, and the medium- and long-term goals of developing lasting political, economic, and social conditions for peace. The EU action in Colombia proposes an understanding of peacebuilding that lies between a maximalist perspective, which advocates the transformation of the whole society, and a minimalist perspective, which limits peacebuilding to obtaining a ceasefire. Thus the EU’s peacebuilding is understood as being comprised of the programs carried out in conflict zones with the perspective of encouraging simultaneous transitions in three dimensions: security, development, and democracy. © 2014, Dorly Castañeda.","Building Peace; Civil Society Organization; European Approach; Land Access; Peace Process","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145215154"

Although there were numerous civil wars occurring during the Cold War era, many of these conflicts went virtually unnoticed unless they were linked to the Cold War struggle for ideological dominance. In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, the number of intra-state conflicts was prevalent around the globe. Along with the occurrence of civil wars, a variety of violent political movements also developed.Examining cases from Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia, this book addresses how violent political movements transform during and after conflict into new types of organisations using the collective political violence transformative (CPVT) model. The study uses a combination of pre-existing literature from the fields of sociology and political science, archival research, and interviews with movement members (former and active) conducted by the author. In studying the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin, the Spear of the Nation (MK) and the African National Congress (ANC), the Abu Sayyaf Group and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP), Transforming Violent Political Movements paints a picture of organisations that have to respond to their environments to survive.This book will be of much interest to students of political violence, terrorism, war and conflict studies, security studies and IR. © 2014 Kevin E.

A leading theory emphasizes the feasibility of insurgency, identifying drug trafficking as the main culprit. I propose an alternative theory of civil violence that emphasizes how bargaining over property rights in the face of deep vertical inequality deepens the subordinate group's social identity, heightens its sense of grievance, and facilitates collective violence. An examination of the history of land reform struggles in Colombia echoes this pattern. Struggles over land reforms in the 1920s and 1930s created new patterns of collective action that helped sustain campesino groups in the ""independent republics"" of the 1950s and 1960s and the creation of the FARC in 1964. This analysis suggests that the Colombian state's lack of credibility on issues of land reform demands a significant third-party enforcement of any peace agreement and confidencebuilding measures between the FARC and the Colombian government. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2014.","Civil war; Colombia; Land reform; Vertical inequality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896777959"

In a post-conflict scenario, the socioeconomic stabilization of displaced households is crucial, as families must decide whether to stay in the reception place, relocate to a new municipality or return to their site of origin. In this paper we identify the determinants of the desire to return of internally displaced households in Colombia. We find that i) land tenure in the place of origin provides an incentive to return; ii) vulnerable households, in particular female-headed households and those from ethnic minorities seek to establish themselves at the reception site and exhibit a lower desire to return; iii) those who displaced as a consequence of a direct attack are less willing to return; iv) economic opportunities in the place of origin encourage return while economic opportunities at the reception site decrease the willingness to return; and v) social networks, as exemplified by membership in peasant organizations and collective land ownership, increase the desire to return. To be successful, the design of stabilization programs for the displaced population must consider these particularities of the households that are willing to return and those who prefer to stay in the reception site. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2014.","Armed conflict; Colombia; Desire to return; Forced displacement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896763064"

This article will explain the success of one of those campaigns carried out principally by the Colombian marines (Colmar) in an area of northern Colombia known as the Montes de María. Contingent factors shaped the success of this campaign, beginning with the fact that the Montes de María forms an area where insurgents, relative late comers to the region, found it difficult to put down deep roots. However, operations to eradicate them were complicated by the inexperience of the Colmar, and by constraints placed by Colombia's Constitutional Court on COIN methods modeled on those successfully applied by the British in Malaya and Kenya. Therefore, Colmar officers initiated their five-year campaign by building up a base of popular support in the towns and targeting insurgent logistical networks. This bought time to strengthen the Colmar's combat and intelligence capabilities, and take the offensive that eventually isolated and killed the leader of the FARC in the Montes de María, Martín Caballero. Unfortunately, the failure of the Colombian government to follow up the Colmar victory by installing a regional and local governments viewed as legitimate by the population, and to resolve long standing land tenure issues, has meant that, so far, the Colmar looks to have delivered a tactical victory in a strategic vacuum. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","COIN; Colombia; FARC; Security Assistance","armed forces; government relations; land tenure; local government; security; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860774273"

Integral to the groups are webbed criminal enterprises, cross-border sanctuaries, and internationally-oriented advocacy networks. Both organizations avoided catastrophic breakdowns through a combination of organic survival mechanisms and precise organizational restructuring. Since 2008, the FARC moved away from a centralized wheel structure model toward a system of multiple decision-making nodes. Guerrilla units now operate in an atomized manner since they are often disconnected from the central leadership. This encouraged a growing number of FARC commanders to focus on narco-profits rather than the organization's ideological goals. Meanwhile, the PKK functions in an octopus-like manner, extending its tentacles into neighboring countries and Europe. However, the process of democratization in Turkey and improved international law enforcement collaboration increased internal as well as external pressure on the PKK to restructure. As a result the PKK is struggling to keep its far-reaching tentacles coordinated. The PKK misjudged its ability to manage political groups which weakened its ideological grip, yet the organization's control over criminal and guerrilla branches continues to be as fierce as ever. The FARC's and the PKK's organizational changes suggest that security agencies in Colombia and Turkey need to adapt their counterterrorism strategies also. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","FARC; Guerrilla groups; Network analysis; Organizational structure; PKK; Transnational organized crime","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859299097"

In recent years, some observers have claimed that interactions between international terrorists and criminals are increasing. If true, expanded links between criminal and terrorist networks could increase U.S. vulnerability to attack by terrorist groups with enhanced criminal capabilities and financial resources. An expanded range of combined criminal and terrorist activity could also affect the global economy and U.S. foreign policy goals, undermining licit international commerce and the promotion of good governance and rule of law. Threats posed by a crime-terrorism nexus may be particularly challenging, as the scale and nature of their cooperation are believed to vary widely and limited anecdotal evidence largely serves as the basis for current understanding of the problem. U.S. efforts to combat the relationship between crime and terrorism are a subset of broader policy responses to transnational crime and international terrorism individually. While numerous U.S. strategies and programs are designed to combat international terrorism and transnational crime separately, fewer efforts focus specifically on addressing the confluence of the two. Those efforts that do exist focus mainly on (1) human smuggling and clandestine terrorist travel, (2) money laundering and terrorist financing, and (3) narcoterrorism links between drug traffickers and terrorists. Many of these efforts, including the creation of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, the reorganization of the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, and the expanded extraterritorial jurisdiction authority to investigate and prosecute international narcoterrorism cases, occurred in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Congress played a large rolein such efforts, holding at least eight hearings specifically on some aspect of criminal-terrorist interactions between the end of 2000 and 2005. Legislation that has expanded and adjusted agency authorities, resources, and responsibilities related to the crime- terrorism nexus includes the USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-5 6), the Intelligence Reform Act and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 107-458), the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-177), and appropriations-related legislation through the 111th Congress for various U.S. agencies, including the Departments of State and Defense. This report provides a primer on the confluence of transnational terrorist and criminal groups and related activities abroad. It evaluates possible motivations and disincentives for cooperation between terrorist and criminal organizations, variations in the scope of crime-terrorism links, and the types of criminal activities-fundraising, material and logistics support, and exploitation of corruption and gaps in the rule of law-used by terrorist organizations to sustain operations. This report also discusses several international case studies to illustrate the range of crime-terrorism convergence and non-convergence, including Dawood Ibrahim's D-Company; the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC); the 2004 Madrid bombers; the Taliban; Hezbollah; Al Qaeda; the 2005 London bombers; Al-Shabaab; as well as known or alleged crime-terrorism facilitators such as Viktor Bout, Monzer Al Kasser, and Abu Ghadiyah. Policy considerations discussed in this report include possible tensions between counterterrorism and anti-crime policy objectives, implications for U.S. foreign aid, gaps in human intelligence and analysis, the value of financial intelligence in combating the crime-terrorism nexus, impact of digital and physical safe havens and ungoverned spaces, implications for nuclear proliferation, and effects of crime- terrorism links in conflict and post-conflict zones. Unless otherwise noted, this report does not address potential crime-terrorism links in the domestic or border environment. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Since the development of Plan Colombia in 1999, the Colombian government, with substantial U.S. support, has stepped up its counternarcotics and security efforts. Congress has provided more than $6 billion to support Colombia from FY2000 through FY2008. Proponents of the current U.S. policy towards Colombia point to the inroads that have been made in improving security conditions and in weakening the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas. Critics argue that, despite these security improvements, U.S. policy has not rigorously promoted human rights, provided for sustainable economic alternatives for drug crop farmers, or reduced the amount of drugs available in the United States. President Alvaro Uribe, re-elected in May 2006, has made headway in addressing Colombia's 40year plus conflict with the country's leftist guerrillas, as well as the rightist paramilitary groups that have been active since the 1980s. Uribe enjoys wide popular support, which has not been significantly affected by an ongoing scandal concerning past government ties to illegal paramilitary groups. Uribe's popularity soared after Colombia's March 2008 raid of a FARC camp in Ecuador resulted in the killing of a top guerrilla commander and the seizure of his computer files. It spiked again following the Colombian military's successful July 2, 2008 rescue of 15 hostages long held by the FARC. Those hostages included three U.S. defense contractors and a former Colombian presidential candidate. While some Colombians are calling for President Uribe to seek a third presidential term, others have been disillusioned by his handling of a series of illegal investment schemes or have concerns about his attempt to remain in power. Concerns in the 110th Congress regarding Colombia focused on funding levels and U.S. policy regarding Plan Colombia, U.S. hostages, trade, and human rights. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) raised the level of U.S. funding provided for economic and social aid closer to that provided for security-related programs. In July 2008, both the House and Senate passed resolutions expressing gratitude to the Colombian government for successfully rescuing the three U.S. hostages being held by the FARC (H.Con.Res. 389/S.Res. 627). The House also passed an amendment (H.Amdt. 112 to H.R. 5959) expressing the importance of continuing to provide U.S. assistance to Colombia. An enacted continuing resolution(P.L. 110329) will provide funding at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. While acknowledging the progress that the Uribe government has made in improving security conditions in Colombia, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about labor activist killings and the parapolitical scandal. These issues received increased attention as the Bush Administration called for Congress to approve implementing legislation for the Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). For more information, see CRS Report RL34470, A U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement: Economic and Political Implications and CRS Report RL34759, Proposed Colombia Free Trade Agreement: Labor Issues. The future of the CFTA in the 111<inf>th</inf> Congress remains uncertain. The 111<inf>th</inf> Congress will likely continue to review the progress of aid provided to Colombia through the Andean Counterdrug Program and continue oversight of human rights, alternative development, eradication efforts, the environmental consequences of aerial fumigation, and the paramilitary demobilization process. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

For him, space was both the source and the objective of political conflict. In this sense, the multiple resistances against the global neoliberal order today can be considered as struggles over space, or, in Lefebvre's words, as a “search for a counterspace”. In this article I will explore some of the territorial implications of such a search, in particular with regard to political mobilizations in Latin America. I will briefly examine the case of the Colombian guerrilla FARC, to then focus on the experience of black population groups in Colombia. The latter have achieved collective land titles in the Colombian Pacific coast region and have become consolidated as legal authorities over those lands within the national territory of the State. However, as I am also going to show, both territorial logics (the black one and the one of the State) articulate themselves at times in a complementary, and at other times in a conflictive way. Up to what point can we talk of a counterspace then, if it gets mediated by the State and dominant power? Is it possible for counterspaces to become part of the national territory? Can we even say that those counterspaces augment the legitimacy of the contemporary State? These questions are analyzed from the viewpoint of political geography and critical geopolitics. © 2010 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Thus, the membership and political agenda of sub-state armed groups not only distinguishes them from criminal groups-organized for and motivated by economic gain-but also shapes their criminal behavior. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70450039980"

It is Latin America's oldest, largest, and best-equipped guerilla organization. The main ideological differences between FARC and the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, ELN), the other major Colombian guerilla group, are that while FARC has a traditional understanding of taking power and of organizational hegemony and structure, the ELN is more orientated toward people's power and movements. Because of the focus on forceful direct action, 31 states in the world have declared FARC a terrorist organization. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, the manifestation of this paradox in a specific context, that of the black peasants' land rights movement in the Chocó region, is explored. Under the aegis of the 1991 Constitution, organisations of black peasants have been making headway in filing for and receiving substantial collective land titles on the basis of a discourse of black ethnic rights. At the same time, and not coincidentally, various armed actors such as the FARC guerrillas and paramilitary forces have made violent inroads into this region. The violence has led to internal displacement, social uprooting, and the disruption of the organisational efforts of the black peasantry. This has put the process of ethnic construction and mobilisation under severe strain. However, black peasants' organisation have been trying to use the land entitlements as a tool to mount a counterstrategy against the violence inflicted by the armed groups.","Afro-Colombians; Colombia; Ethnicity; Guerrilla; Land rights; Paramilitary; Peasantry; Violence","black population; community organization; land rights; violence; Choco; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035652602"
