The Ganga Basin—one of the most populated basins—is experiencing rapid and abrupt urbanization over several decades, with significant loss of natural lakes and wetlands resulting in degradation of aquatic ecosystems. This study analyzed the long-term and multiple changes and the drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) of Karela Lake—an oxbow lake in the southern part of Lucknow, India, in the central part of the Ganga Basin, over the past 48 years from 1976 to 2024 using a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) model. Karela Lake serves as a vital wetland ecosystem, supporting a variety of species and acting as a crucial water source for over a dozen nearby villages. The results indicate a 90.64% decrease in wetland area as the prominent land use change during 1976–2024. The lake is shrinking due to land encroachment and farming, with a substantial reduction in the lake margin. The Markov chain prediction method is used to predict the future LULC around Karela Lake. The year 2040 scenario shows that agricultural land and built-up area will increase substantially, with a decrease in scrub land and lakes’ wetted area. The major driving factors responsible for the degradation of the lake are the encroachment, land use change, pollution, intensive agriculture, and groundwater over-extraction. The study recommends a stricter land use policy, along with the demarcation of the lake’s boundary by the state wetland authority to prevent further encroachment and to support a diverse range of aquatic wildlife. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.","Geospatial analysis; Land use and land cover (LULC) change; Landsat imagery; Markov Chain (MC) model; Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network","Agricultural pollution; Animals; Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Chains; Lake pollution; Lakes; Land use; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Wetlands; Fresh Water; Ganga basin; Geo-spatial analysis; Land use and land cover; Land use and land cover change; Land use/land cover; Landsat imagery; Landuse change; Markov chain models; Multilayer perceptrons neural networks (MLPs); Markov processes; land cover; land use; Landsat; spatial analysis; accuracy; agricultural land; agriculture; Article; artificial neural network; biodiversity; cellular automaton; ecosystem; farming system; freshwater environment; geographic information system; geospatial tools; imagery; intensive agriculture; lake; lake basin; landsat imagery; Markov chain; multilayer perceptron; multiple land use/land cover transitions; nerve cell network; pollution; reaction optimization; regression model; tropics; urban sprawl; urbanization; vegetation dynamics; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; India; procedures; wetland; Ganges Basin; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Urbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105029032101"

While previous studies have focused on large-scale deforestation, this study explores the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery’s capabilities in mapping small-scale canopy disturbances that usually precede permanent forest conversion in tropical forests to fill the gap of the lack of information on the small-scale canopy disturbance dynamics in the ARFR. Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) was applied to map canopy gaps, and annual change detection within 100 m × 100 m grids was used to track canopy disturbances. The study assessed how disturbances correlated with elevation, slope, aspect, distance from the forest edge, and proximity to river channels. Results revealed a consistent trend in deforestation and canopy gaps, except in 2024, when gap coverage decreased, signalling a higher rate of forest recovery compared to previous years. Canopy gaps were also found to transition rapidly from ‘low’ to ‘high’ disturbance levels annually. Disturbances mostly showed increasing patterns with proximity to forest edge and river channels while showing increase-then-decrease patterns with elevation and slope. Disturbances were mostly west-facing in relation to aspect. The relationships inferred a likely anthropogenic source of the disturbances in the ARFR and advise increased monitoring of small-scale canopy disturbance activities. © 2026 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Atewa; geospatial; GIS; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Spectral mixture analysis","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Logging (forestry); Satellite imagery; Atewa; Canopy disturbance; Canopy gaps; Forest edge; Forest reserves; Geo-spatial; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Small scale; Spectral mixture analysis; Geographic information systems; Remote sensing","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105028132516"

Peatland areas are particularly vulnerable due to their unique ecological characteristics and human-induced disturbances. The objective of this study is to map, analyze, and investigate forest fire risk and fire spread in peatlands within South Sumatra, Indonesia, from 2014 to 2023 using Remote Sensing and GIS technologies. Key geomorphological, environmental, and human activity parameters were assessed, including slope, elevation, temperature, distance to roads, and land cover. Each parameter was classified into five fire hazard levels, and a comprehensive forest fire risk map was generated using an overlay approach via the intersect method in ArcGIS. The analysis revealed that 74% of South Sumatra’s area is classified as having high to very high fire risk, with peatlands being the most vulnerable regions due to their low elevation, gentle slopes, moderate to high temperatures, and proximity to roads, which facilitate human access. Fire propagation was further examined using dNBR (differenced Normalized Burn Ratio), dNDVI (differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and hotspot data from NASA’s FIRMS. The dNBR and dNDVI analysis identified fluctuations in burn severity over the years, with significant damage observed in 2015, 2018, and 2022. However, the results of dNDVI and dNBR do not align due to differences in spectral sensitivity and atmospheric effects. Hotspot density analyzed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), highlighted fire-prone zones, particularly in peatland regions. Findings show that human activity, coupled with climatic phenomena such as El Niño, significantly influences fire risk and propagation in South Sumatra, Indonesia. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Burn severity; Forest fire risk; GIS-based modeling; Hotspot mapping; Peat fire dynamics","disturbance; fire management; forest fire; GIS; mapping method; NDVI; peatland; remote sensing; risk assessment; Indonesia; South Sumatra","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105026471865"

This study assesses the combined impacts of urbanization and climate change on flooding in eight identified hotspots in Peshawar based on reports from the Water and Sanitation Services Peshawar (WSSP). Climate projections utilize precipitation data from CMIP6 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (1980–2100). Bias correction through quantile mapping and performance evaluation identified BCC-CSM2-MR as the top-performing Global Circulation Model (GCM), with the five best models used for future projections. Land cover analysis using Landsat imagery (2000 and 2024) from the USGS was processed in GIS and classified into built-up areas, barren land, cropland, and water bodies, revealing significant urban expansion. Saturation years were estimated based on annual growth rates for each hotspot. Rainfall-runoff modeling in WinTR-20 was conducted for land cover scenarios in 2000, 2024, and projected saturation years, as well as climate projections, to estimate peak flows. Results indicate rapid urbanization, with saturation expected by 2025 in Hotel Grand and Madina Colony and by 2034 in National Bank Colony and Warsak Road. Under SSP5-8.5, precipitation could increase by up to 81% with a 200-year return period. Hydrological modeling predicts rising peak flows across all catchments, with NB Colony reaching 112 m3 s−1 under urbanization and extreme climate scenarios, approximately 114% higher than the peak value in the year 2024.

This study aimed to analyze, map, and simulate LULC changes in the southern mesoregion of Maranhão State by generating geospatial scenarios projected through 2030. LULC changes between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed using Landsat images classified with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. A spatial model based on cellular automata was employed to simulate land use and land cover scenarios for the year 2030. When comparing the simulated map with the reference map, an overall accuracy of 70.28% and a Kappa index of 0.608 were observed. Results revealed a decrease in native savanna and grassland areas, with a corresponding increase in agricultural and pasturelands, notably in municipalities such as Balsas, Riachão, Tasso Fragoso, Carolina and Porto Franco. The 2030 simulation predicts continued agricultural expansion and a potential reduction of approximately 19% in native Cerrado vegetation cover, highlighting municipalities of Campestre do Maranhão, Porto Franco, São João do Paraíso, Feira Nova, Estreito, Balsas, Tasso Fragoso and Carolina. These findings underscore the value of integrating remote sensing and spatial modeling techniques within the framework of Geomatics to support environmental monitoring and management of land-use dynamics, including expansion, contraction, diversification, and agricultural intensification.

This study constructs a Composite Environmental Degradation Index (CEDI) for 397 counties in Iran (2018–2022) by integrating multi-source satellite observations with a stochastic dominance (SD) algorithm and mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based weighting. Seven environmental dimensions were incorporated: climate change, greenhouse gases, land use, biodiversity, water resources, air pollution, and soil erosion. Quantitative results indicate that the SD–MIP approach assigns the highest contributions to climate change (0.279), greenhouse gases (0.226), and land use (0.223), while air pollution and soil erosion exert relatively lower impacts. Spatial autocorrelation analysis (Getis–Ord Gi∗) reveals statistically significant hot spots of environmental degradation across the western, southern, southeastern, and central regions, whereas cold spots are concentrated along the northern belt, particularly within the Hyrcanian forests, indicating greater ecological resilience. Temporally, although year-to-year fluctuations were observed, the overall trend suggests a gradual intensification of environmental stress, with the peak average CEDI reaching 0.58 in 2018 and 2020. Methodologically, applying stochastic dominance to composite index construction eliminates the bias of arbitrary weighting, incorporates the full distribution of each indicator, and quantifies uncertainty through Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis (n = 1000). The results demonstrate high robustness (mean Spearman's ρ = 0.91; SD = 0.03; mean Jaccard hotspot overlap = 85.2 %), confirming the model's stability and reliability. From a policy perspective, the CEDI functions as an early-warning and decision-support system, enabling region-specific interventions in high-risk areas while reinforcing sustainable practices in resilient regions. The proposed framework directly supports Sustainable Development Goals 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land) and can be adapted to other developing-country contexts with diverse environmental and data conditions. © 2025 The Authors.","Composite indicators; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; Stochastic dominance; Sustainable development policies","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105025647977"

However, tracking progress under the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) policy, which aims to balance degradation with restoration, requires a systematic assessment of cumulative trends, a critical underexplored gap. Here, we present the first comprehensive annual assessment of land-use changes in these hotspots (1992–2022) guided by the LDN framework. We found that 9.4% of hotspots experienced land-use change, with rates declining by 0.06 Mha/year (1992–2015) before accelerating to 0.4 Mha/year (2016–2022). While human-driven impacts (e.g., deforestation, agriculture shifts) initially dominated, causing net natural ecosystem losses, post-2015 land-use improvement efforts (e.g., revegetation) increased. Yet, net land-use degradation outweighed improvement, resulting in a land-use debt of 29.1 Mha (0.9% of global hotspots). Driven by tropical deforestation, dryland degradation, agricultural shifts and urbanization, this debt correlated with impaired ecosystem structure and function. For instance, agricultural dynamics strongly correlated with reduced greenness in high-debt continents like Asia and the Americas (r = −0.92 and r = −0.80, respectively). Despite continental-scale greenness stabilization post-2015 (stable NDVI > 92%), these regions showed reversed carbon uptake, with net primary productivity declining to −0.0032 and −0.002 Kg C/m2 yr−1, respectively. This vegetation greenness paradox, where stable structural greenness masks functional degradation, reveals that current improvements remain insufficient to offset historical degradation, and that structural stabilization may not guarantee functional integrity. Thus, reversing land-use debt necessitates a locally tailored policy framework that prioritizes functional recovery alongside structural greening to ensure LDN restoration practices deliver ecosystem integrity in these hotspots. © 2025.

Multi-temporal Landsat imagery was classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, achieving high classification performance (overall accuracy 89%, Kappa 0.86). Results reveal a striking 32.09% expansion of built-up areas, accompanied by a 17.91% decline in forest cover and a 4% reduction in agricultural land, reflecting accelerated urban sprawl and landscape conversion. The Entropy-based Groundwater Quality Index (EGWQI) exhibited a strong inverse relationship with built-up areas (r = − 0.91) and a highly positive association with forests and water bodies (r ≥ 0.98), underscoring the buffering role of natural ecosystems. Although 86.7% of wells remain in the ‘Excellent’ category, persistent contamination hotspots were identified near industrial and agricultural clusters, with risks amplified during monsoonal runoff events. Proximity and correlation analyses confirmed that industrial zones and quarries are critical drivers of localized groundwater degradation.

While numerous studies analyze UHI, there remains a gap in integrating zoning regulations with Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) patterns to assess how land use policies influence urban heat distribution. This study addresses this gap by investigating SUHI variations across land use categories in Chennai, a tropical megacity experiencing rapid urban expansion. Using Landsat 5 TM (2006) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2022) thermal imagery, the study analyzes Land Surface Temperature (LST), Land Contribution Index (LCI) which measures each land use's contribution to urban heat, Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) which quantifies land use wise urban thermal stress, and building footprint data. Unlike conventional studies that rely on Local Climate Zones (LCZ), land use categories from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) Master Plan (2006–2026) serve as an alternative zoning framework. The study provides a framework for identification of hotspots and cold spots across the land use categories provided in the Master Plan. The study also identifies key locations for Atmospheric UHI (AUHI) data collection in the future through data loggers, weather stations, and mobile traverse measurements.

Annually, 100–400 million cases are reported, with over 14 million cases and 10,000 deaths in 2024 alone, highlighting the public health challenge of dengue, especially in tropical and subtropical urban areas. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a critical factor in dengue transmission, creating favorable conditions for Aedes mosquitoes. This study examines the impact of UHIs on dengue incidence at Thanjavur Municipal Corporation, Tamil Nadu, India, via remote sensing-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) and epidemiological data from 2017 to 2023. High-resolution thermal and optical imagery was used to assess spatial variations in urban surface temperature, whereas dengue incidence patterns were analysed through hotspot detection and statistical analysis. The study also examines land use and land cover characteristics in modulating dengue risk. The findings revealed strong positive correlations between UHIs, built-up zones, and dengue hotspots. UHI analysis revealed that dengue incidence is highest in areas with moderate heat exposure, not in urban cores with extreme temperatures; only 30.2% of dengue cases occurred within UHI zones, suggesting that extreme temperatures (> 48 °C) may suppress Aedes mosquito survival. The land use analysis revealed that built-up areas (45.85%) were strongly correlated with dengue cases (p = 0.822, p < 0.01), whereas vegetation (40.98%) and water bodies (2.82%) were negatively correlated, indicating their role in influencing dengue transmission. The findings underscore the critical influence of UHIs on dengue incidence and the need for targeted interventions, including dengue-sensitive urban planning focused on maintaining green spaces, ensuring proper drainage, and minimising water stagnation to balance vegetation benefits with vector control. © The Author(s) 2025.","Dengue fever; Land surface temperature; Land use and land cover; Urban heat Islands","adverse event; Aedes; animal; city; dengue; epidemiology; high temperature; human; incidence; India; mosquito vector; procedures; remote sensing; Animals; Cities; Dengue; Hot Temperature; Humans; Incidence; Mosquito Vectors; Remote Sensing Technology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014603481"

We mapped soil loss at 30 m using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and quantified the erosion-control service in El Cajas National Park, Ecuador (28,544 ha) using an NDVI-based index. Replacing categorical land cover C factors with a continuous NDVI surface increased the park-wide soil loss estimate by ∼58%, yielding an area-weighted mean of 5.3 t ha−1 yr−1 and local maxima of 120 t ha−1 yr−1 on steep and sparsely vegetated escarpments. Relative to a bare soil scenario, existing páramo grasslands, shrub mosaics, and scattered Polylepis woodlots avert 95% of potential erosion, quantifying the service supplied by vegetation. Between 2023 and 2024, a ∼60% rise in mean NDVI more than doubled the area delivering moderate-to-high erosion control. A hot-spot analysis further identified ∼30 km2 (≈5% of the park) where high modeled soil loss coincides with low protection; these clusters generate ∼80% of predicted sediment and constitute priority targets for restoration or visitor use regulation. The integrated RUSLE–NDVI–EC approach provides a concise and transferable screening tool for aligning conservation investments with Ecuador’s restoration pledges and for safeguarding critical hydrological services in Andean protected areas. © 2025 by the authors.","Andean páramo; conservation planning; erosion hotspots; Google Earth Engine; remote sensing; soil retention","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105023086895"

A comprehensive framework integrating the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) and Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) simulations was employed. Multi-source datasets, including remote sensing imagery, geographic, meteorological, and socio-economic data, were combined with the Markov–FLUS model to simulate future land-use patterns. The results indicate extensive urban expansion and a notable increase in construction land, accompanied by a continuous decline in RSEI values, particularly under the business-as-usual scenario. In contrast, policy-guided simulations suggest more sustainable land allocation and gradual improvement in ecological quality.

Passive restoration is a strategy used to recover its ecosystem, with remote sensing technology enabling monitoring of forest recovery and environmental changes. This study applied multi-temporal analysis using environmental data and vegetation indices to assess a passive restoration area in a reserve at Brotas, Brazil. Data were gathered from a meteorological station and Landsat-8 satellite images. Vegetation indices such as the Simple Ratio Index (SRI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were calculated and analyzed over time (2014–2020) by year and season (winter and summer). The environmental analysis revealed seasonal differences, highlighting the contrast between the dry winter months and wet summer months. All vegetation indices varied across years, SRI and EVI also showing seasonal differences. A noticeable deviation was observed in 2014–2015, attributed to the severe drought of 2014, with a lagged response in vegetation. Our results demonstrate that vegetation indices are effective tools for assessing ecological resilience under climate extremes and can provide evidence for designing public policies. Specially, linking passive restoration outcomes to land tenure security and watershed conservation highlights the role of tenure – restoration nexus in ensuring log-term success. These findings have implications for conservation policy in Brazil and elsewhere, reinforcing that ecological recovery strategies must be integrated with land use and land tenure frameworks to achieve sustainable climate adaptation and ecosystem services. © 2025 The Authors","GIS; Temporal analysis; Tropical savanna; Vegetation index; Watershed","biome; ecosystem service; environmental change; land tenure; NDVI; remote sensing; temporal analysis; vegetation index; Brazil; Brotas; Sao Paulo [Brazil]","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015187234"

By setting natural ecological space use control measures, namely Ecological Conservation Redline, the spatiotemporal variations in land use/land cover and habitat quality were investigated under two regulatory scenarios: natural development (ND) and ecological priority (EP). The study revealed that: (1) Under the natural development (ND) regulatory scenario, from 2007 to 2021, artificial ecosystems such as farmland, water bodies, and construction land showed an increasing trend, while natural ecosystems such as forests, shrubs, and grasslands exhibited a decreasing trend in the study area. (2) Between 2007 and 2021, the habitat quality in the study area exhibited a decreasing trend, with a total reduction of 3.12%. (3) From 2021 to 2035, compared to the natural development (ND) scenario, under the ecological priority (EP) regulatory scenario, influenced by the Ecological Conservation Redline, the area of natural ecosystems in the study area showed an increasing trend, with an overall improvement in habitat quality by 0.34%, an increase in excellent quality habitat area of 57.12 km2, and a significant improvement in habitat quality levels.

This study quantifies how land-cover composition shapes land surface temperature (LST) in North Jakarta’s Penjaringan District and translates findings into policy metrics. Methodology: We mapped land cover (Google Earth object-based image analysis) and retrieved LST from Landsat (2005–2024). Variables were aggregated on a 150 ×150 m grid (n = 242) and related via ordinary least squares to estimate class-specific effects. Results & Conclusions: Built-up area expanded (+113%) while mangroves increased (+77%); cool LST classes collapsed and warm classes proliferated. Regression yields a stable hierarchy: built-up is the strongest warming driver; mangroves provide the strongest natural cooling; water and other vegetation also cool. On a per-fraction basis, mangrove cooling effectiveness is ~59% of built-up warming. These results establish quantitative, planning-scale evidence that nature-based assets can materially blunt urban heating in a dense coastal setting. Implications: We operationalize the evidence into four auditable indicators—Minimum Green-Space per Block, Canopy Connectivity Index, Per-Parcel Pervious Ratio, and a Cooling-Deficit Limit— and an adaptation-zoning workflow targeting persistent hotspots, impervious corridors, and coastal buffers. The metrics fit routine permitting and support annual, satellite-based audits, offering a replicable path to climate-resilient urban development. © 2025 The authors.

This study addresses critical gaps in understanding the interplay between urban sprawl and densification processes in Baqubah, Iraq, a city experiencing rapid population growth within fixed spatial boundaries. Employing an integrated methodological framework, this research utilized satellite imagery from Landsat 7, 8, and 9 datasets, preprocessed with radiometric corrections using ENVI, GIS, and Google Earth software. Land cover data were classified through the maximum likelihood classification method to reveal spatial transformations over three decades (1992, 2007, and 2022). To analyze urban growth dynamics, the Holdren Index quantified the contributions of population growth and per capita land use changes. Spatial autocorrelation methods, including Moran's Index, High/Low Clustering, and Hot Spot Analysis, were applied to detect clustering patterns and significant spatial hotspots. Additionally, the MICMAC structural analysis method identified interdependencies among key drivers of urban sprawl. The findings indicate that urban growth in Baqubah from 1992 to 2022 has predominantly manifested as densification, with built-up areas increasing from 33.29% to 46.55%. Factors such as housing investment, shape index, economic growth, and planning policies emerged as critical drivers shaping these patterns. The research emphasizes sustainable strategies, including vertical expansion, green infrastructure preservation, participatory governance, and advanced spatial monitoring, to mitigate the adverse effects of sprawl while promoting sustainable urban development.

However, its expansion, especially in high-precipitation and mountainous regions of developing countries, has sparked growing concerns about its role in exacerbating downstream flood risks. This study critically examines the complex relationship between hydropower development and flood risk through the analysis of 107 major hydropower dams in such regions of the world spanning a period of 40 years. While 41.1% of the studied dams were found to exhibit flood mitigating characteristics by buffering against extreme inflows, 26.2% of dams were likely to exacerbate flood risks, primarily due to a steady increase in precipitation rates and sedimentation-induced capacity loss. Hydropower dams in regions with shorter downstream river lengths were found to be more flood-inducing than flood-protecting. While regions with flood-protecting dams naturally trigger urbanization and economic growth due to perceived safety and stable energy availability, these benefits are accompanied by the cost of increased deforestation. The study identified hotspots in South America and South Asia, where hydropower dams are more likely to be clustered as flood inducing in nature. Overall, the study calls for a paradigm shift in hydropower planning and management, emphasizing the integration of adaptive flood risk mitigation into energy production strategies keeping in mind the anticipated changes in climate and land cover along with a robust sedimentation management strategy during the dam's service lifespan. © 2025.

The Terai Duars Savanna and Grasslands ecoregion (hereafter, Terai) is a heterogeneous woodland-grassland mosaic where pure grasslands occur despite relatively high rainfall. The factors that maintain grasslands under such conditions are poorly understood. We studied grassland persistence in a Terai ecosystem in northeastern India by deriving land use land cover (LULC) classification from Landsat images (30 m) and examining vegetation transitions over a 34-year period. Overall, we found high dynamism, with balanced interchange between grasslands and woodlands even over brief time intervals. However, in the last 15 years, the changes have favored woodland formation, resulting in a 24% decline in grassland area. We tested the influence of several environmental, anthropogenic, and topographic factors on grassland persistence at fine spatial scales over seven time intervals (~ 5 years each). We used non-spatial generalized linear mixed models and spatial regression models in a Bayesian framework with conditional autoregressive priors. Both models revealed that grassland persistence was favored by fire and anthropogenic influences (quantified as distance from human habitation), whereas a greater extent of the grass-woodland ecotone and proximity to water bodies reduced persistence.

Given its importance at a global level, this research presents a literature review on the application of remote sensing to identify the drivers of deforestation in savannas worldwide. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were used for this purpose, and systematic analyses was conducted. From a systematic perspective, articles addressing the main drivers of deforestation in savannas, remote sensing products, perspectives, and methodologies for identifying deforestation drivers at different spatial scales were considered. From a bibliographic perspective, the results revealed 169 papers. The results of the systematic review showed that agriculture and cattle grazing are the main drivers of deforestation in savannas. Other important drivers of savanna degradation, such as forestry, reforestation, mining activities, and the invasion of exotic grasses, are generally underrepresented drivers of deforestation. Regarding the methodological approaches used to identify the drivers of deforestation in savannas, the most common include assessing transition matrices and land cover changes. LANDSAT and MODIS were the most commonly used remote sensing products. Finally, despite the crucial role of savannas at the global level, studies on deforestation drivers in this biome are less developed compared to biomes such as tropical forests, which have received greater academic attention. Thus, this research contributes to identifying gaps in current knowledge, highlighting the relevance of new methods and new studies in this ecosystem. © 2025 Elsevier GmbH","Satellite Imagery; Savannas; Semi-arid environments; Systematic review","deforestation; environmental degradation; Landsat; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite imagery; savanna; semiarid region","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000673551"

The Sundarbans deltaic region, witnessing the confluence of vast expanses of tropical mangrove forests, tidal rivers, and estuaries, is one such area. Considered as one of the richest biodiversity hotspot zones on earth, home to a large spectrum of biodiversity (flora and fauna), including endangered or threatened species, this forest plays a critical role in land reclamation, coastal habitat protection, and local socioeconomics. However, the forests have been experiencing changes due to climatic forces and anthropogenic activities. Monitoring these changes is crucial for adopting precise management practices. In this work, Landsat 8 images were used to identify the land use and land cover in the Sundarbans. For classification, a new Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is proposed. A comparative analysis of the Overall Accuracy (OA) of the proposed DNN model with two popular Machine Learning models, Random Forest and XGBoost showed 98.9%, 97.0%, and 98.1% OA, respectively. SHapely Additive exPlanations were used for each model to obtain important features. It was observed that Near-Infrared, Short Wave Infrared 1, Blue, and Enhanced Vegetation Index were the most important features. The proposed DNN model outperformed the RF and XGBoost models with these four important features, achieving 98.5% accuracy. In comparison, it was concluded that deep learning techniques are more effective in feature selection from remote sensing images. © Indian Society of Remote Sensing 2025.","Deep neural network (DNN); Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Random forest; Sundarbans; XGBoost","artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; biodiversity; climate change; comparative study; endangered species; habitat conservation; human activity; land cover; land use change; mangrove; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sundarbans","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217267264"

This study evaluates gross primary productivity (GPP) in the Itatiaia National Park (PNI), one of Brazil's oldest conservation units, using 19 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer remote sensing data (2001–2020) and 3 years of micrometeorological tower data (2018–2020). GPP was estimated through models integrating vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI] and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and validated against FLUXNET data. Seasonal analysis revealed higher GPP values during the rainy season, peaking at 8.07 g C m⁻² day⁻¹ in September, while agricultural areas exhibited the highest GPP, with annual averages above 9.00 g C m⁻² day⁻¹. Temporal trends indicated a decline in GPP across all land use classes, with the most pronounced reduction in vegetative refuges (Z<inf>mk</inf> = −1.65, P < 0.10). Among the models tested, the GPP equation using EVI and PAR yielded the highest accuracy (R² = 0.49, d = 0.89, standard error of estimate = 1.91).

Gazipur, the industrial hub of Bangladesh, is at the forefront of this urbanization surge driven by development activities. This study employs a machine learning algorithm to forecast the future state of Gazipur district. Landsat images spanning from 1990 to 2020, with a decadal interval, were utilized. The supervised classification scheme, employing the maximum likelihood classifier, was applied in the analysis. The prediction phase incorporated the Cellular Automata- Artificial Neural network algorithm. The study reveals an estimated urban area of 124.5 km2 by 2030, signifying an expansion of approximately 20 km2 during 2020 to 2030. This equates to an annual urban growth rate of 2 km2, accounting for a 19.7% expansion. The study also reflects the direction of urban expansion, with south, south-west, and north zones exhibiting higher urbanization levels due to their proximity to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and key transportation routes such as the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway and Dhaka bypass. Notably, this rapid urbanization exerts significant pressure on agricultural land, which would reduce to 594 km2 by 2030, potentially conflicting with the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture).

In this context, this pioneering study in the Eastern Himalayan region conducted the first comprehensive assessment of long-term, large-scale deforestation using the deep learning algorithm U-Net, employing a novel approach by modifying the model to accommodate multiple tensor inputs during the training, unlike the conventional single tensor input method. The U-Net model demonstrated a testing accuracy of 84% after 100 epochs, with no notable improvements observed even after extending training to 1000 epochs. Therefore, the model trained for 100 epochs was selected for further analysis, demonstrating stable performance without signs of overfitting. Key performance metrics indicate robust image segmentation capabilities, including a precision of 0.82, recall of 0.79, and intersection over union of 0.68. These results underscore the model’s effectiveness in capturing temporal patterns and the changes in forest cover. This study examined significant deforestation trends over the past 34 years (from 1990 to 2024), revealing a drastic reduction in forest cover by 581.92 km², from 1,091.82 km² in 1990 to 509.90 km² in 2024, with an annual deforestation rate of 2.24%.

Nevertheless, anthropogenic factors have destroyed these valuable habitats at unprecedented levels. Consequently, there is a growing consensus on the importance of achieving effective mechanisms to improve conservation efforts. Nonetheless, studies on long-term spatiotemporal monitoring of the effect of forest loss on landscape connectivity in biodiversity hotspots in tropical regions are scarce, although they are crucial for devising appropriate strategies to maintain natural levels of connectivity in the landscape. This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest loss and its effects on landscape connectivity in a biodiversity hotspot in southern Africa from 1984 to 2023. Landsat satellite images, field data, and geographic information systems were used to assess the dynamics of forest loss and its driving forces. The graph theory approach was employed to evaluate changes in landscape connectivity using six dispersal distances (50 to 10000 m) covering a wide range of dispersal and movement abilities of different plant and animal species. Connectivity indices in combination with statistical models were used to investigate the effect of individual forest patches and the loss of critical patches on landscape connectivity. The results indicated that forest habitat faced a loss trend during 1984–2023 due to unsustainable human activities, with a total loss of 7.5 km2. Deforestation decreased with increasing elevation and distance from roads and built-ups. The overall connectivity for all dispersal distances decreased over time due to the loss of forest patches across the landscape. Patches crucial for maintaining connectivity declined progressively. The findings also revealed that a patch decreases its contribution to overall connectivity when it decreases in area and becomes simpler. Additionally, small patches function as stepping stones and make the habitat configuration more suitable for biodiversity conservation than when there are only large but very isolated patches. This research provides meaningful insights into the dynamics of landscape connectivity and critical patches for connectivity, which is crucial for biodiversity conservation and management in a changing world. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity hotspots; Graph theory; Landscape change; Patch connectivity; Spatial analysis","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; connectivity; conservation planning; GIS; graphical method; habitat conservation; habitat loss; hot spot; Landsat; landscape change; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; Africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001072808"

Over a montane biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar highlands (Ankaratra Massif), we conducted analysis on land cover change with Landsat satellite sensor data to identify the magnitude of change (1995–2016) and on the habitat change–amphibian diversity relationship to understand links with biodiversity. The results evidenced that 17.8% of the biodiversity hotspot experienced change in land cover in only 20 years. That pressured the already threatened forests, particularly since 2005. Of the total forest area in 1995 (2062.7 ha), 21.5% was cleared by 2016 (1618.3 ha). Changes in forest cover followed a bidirectional pattern. While in the period 1995–2005, forests expanded at a rate of 2.0% year−1 (from 2062.7 to 2524.8 ha), the area declined between 2005 and 2016 at a rate of − 4.1% year−1, fourfold the rate reported nationally for Madagascar (− 1.1% year−1). Forest-to-shrubland transitions emerged as being of increasing concern to forest integrity. We identified a significant link between habitat change and amphibian diversity, but only for species richness. Counter to expectations, no significant relationship was found between species richness and deforestation rates, and between microendemism rates and any of the habitat change variables. Species richness responded to the spatiotemporal variability in vegetation dynamics represented by the standard deviation of the Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI_std). Species richness was strongly negatively related to NDVI_std in the short-term (R2 = 0.91, p = 0.003) and long-term (R2 = 0.69, p = 0.03), increasing where the spatiotemporal variability in NDVI was lower. The magnitude of changes in this biodiversity hotspot suggests that region-specific assessments are necessary in the context of the tropical change narrative in Africa and should consider conservation policies tailored for local conditions. Reducing deforestation and land conversion rates through a management plan codesigned with local communities is urgent. Habitat change appears to impact on amphibian diversity by altering the functional attributes of the habitat and not just by reducing habitat extent. NDVI_std seems a relevant indirect metric for monitoring such change although other biophysical attributes obtained from satellite sensor data should be integrated and explored. © The Author(s) 2023.","Amphibian diversity; Forest loss; Land cover change; Natural reserves; Remote sensing mapping; Tropical montane cloud forest","amphibian; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; cloud forest; deforestation; forest cover; Landsat; landscape change; mapping; nature reserve; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite sensor; species richness; vegetation dynamics; Madagascar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001061085"

The main limitations of this study are the lack of daily sediment data, lithology, higher-resolution DEM data, and socioeconomic factors. Poor land use policy and resource management in the Upper Awash Sub-basin lead to soil erosion and sedimentation of hydrological infrastructure, Effective watershed prioritization requires integrating land use, hydrology, sediment load, and morphometric factors but often faces gaps, especially in the study area. This research aims to prioritise the Upper Awash Sub-Basin by its morphometric, land use and cover (LULC), and sediment yield characteristics. We used the integrated AHP-VIKOR multi-attribute decision-making method to prioritise watersheds, incorporating morphometry, LULC, and sediment load attributes in the simple matrix approach. The findings showed the following classes of erosion: exceedingly high (2722.14 km2), high (2524.46 km2), moderate (2205.48 km2), low (1611.43 km2), and extremely low (854.35 km2). Sub-watersheds WS6, WS8, WS10, WS13, and WS24 are the top priority for watershed management. The study ranked watersheds based on various attributes but encountered limitations such as the lack of daily sediment data, geological structure, and lithology. It can be concluded that this approach is very important to identify and categorize hotspots of soil erosion sub-watersheds for planners and decision-makers for conserving water and soil and for different environmental management purposes. © © 2024 by the author(s).","AHP; MCDM; Morphometric Analysis; Soil Erosion; SWAT; VIKOR","analytical hierarchy process; digital elevation model; GIS; morphometry; prioritization; sediment yield; sedimentation; soil erosion; watershed; Awash Basin; Ethiopia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210385461"

This study overcomes this research gap by integrating a geographic information system (GIS) with the frequency ratio (FR) method to produce an accurate and scientifi-cally based map of drought-prone zones. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to apply the FR method to assess drought vulnerability at the watershed scale in South Sulawesi, thus contributing a new and data-driven framework to advance spatial drought analysis in the tropical environments. The FR analysis used seven drought-related factors: rainfall, land cover, building density, hotspots, vegetation density, slope, and river distance. The results of the LST analysis revealed that approximately 43.25% of the area in the Bila watershed experienced drought, primarily due to moderate building density and residential land cover, as indicated by high FR values of 2.98 and 2.89, respectively. The results of mapping the Bila watershed's drought-prone zones show that areas with high to very high drought vulnerability categories tend to be concentrated in paddy fields, residential areas, dryland agriculture, and areas with moderate building density. The spatial distribution pattern reveals that the downstream areas of the Bila watershed exhibit a greater level of drought vulnerability than the upstream regions do. © 2025, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE).

These water towers face heterogeneous land use and land cover (LULC) changes causing disproportionate hydrological impacts and distinct vulnerabilities. Such changes threaten water availability and increase climate-related water extremes. Understanding the hotspot patterns is critical to managing these vulnerable systems. This study investigates LULC changes at Mt. Kenya water tower and its surroundings at multiple spatial scales and evaluates their impacts on hydrology using the SWAT+ model. LULC classifications were prepared using the random forest algorithm on Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery. Results showed significant overall LULC change: agriculture and mixed forest increased by +8.1% and +4.7%, while evergreen forest and shrubland decreased by −3.5% and −7.5%, respectively. Sub-basin analysis indicated heterogeneous LULC changes. The SWAT+ model showed a Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.80 and 0.78, and a very good percent bias (PBIAS) of −7.4 and −6.9, for calibration and validation, respectively. Significant sub-basin changes were observed in evapotranspiration (+19.6% to −7.3), water yield (+11.4% to −7.4%), surface runoff (+11.4% to −7.4%), and percolation (+13.9% to −8.3%). Correlations showed that the loss of vegetation reduced evapotranspiration and increased water yield, surface runoff, and percolation, with opposite trends for increasing vegetation. Hence, anthropogenically induced LULC change significantly impacts water towers’ hydrology. The uneven impacts reveal unique LULC change patterns for which befitting adaptive and mitigative measures are needed. © The Author(s) 2025.","Hydrological changes; Kenya; Land use change; Multi-spatial analysis; SWAT+ model; Water balance","","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019071878"

This study investigates long-term vegetation dynamics in the Rwenzori Mountains using time series remote sensing data from 2002 to 2024. Specifically, four vegetation indices and biophysical parameters, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), were analyzed to assess spatial and temporal trends and identify ecological stress patterns. Using hotspot analysis and trend detection, we observed marked spatial heterogeneity in vegetation health. Coldspots, often located above 3000 m or in lowland areas with high human activity, showed persistent vegetation decline. In contrast, hotspots between 1400 and 2800 m in the northeastern, eastern, and southern regions indicated relatively stable and healthy vegetation cover. Temporally, significant negative trends were detected in FPAR during December and in both FPAR and LAI during the Dec–Jan–Feb (DJF) season, suggesting seasonal ecological stress. While some positive but statistically non-significant trends were recorded in June and September, NDVI revealed a consistent and significant annual decline, indicating long-term vegetation degradation. These findings underscore the pressing need for sustainable land use and conservation strategies to protect high-altitude tropical ecosystems from ongoing ecological decline. © The Author(s) 2025.","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change; Ecological stress; Hotspot analysis; Rwenzori mountains; Vegetation dynamics","","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013546251"

The ability to optimally harness solar energy requires accurate identification of suitable sites. Thus, this study aimed to identify optimal sites for solar power plant sites in Zimbabwe using climatic, economic, and environmental factors, and visualise results through a Web-GIS. The study also considered the impact of future land use and temperature changes in identifying future solar power plant suitable sites. Land use changes for 2040 were predicted using a cellular automata model and for temperature, projected 2040 annual temperature was considered. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used for deriving criteria weights and the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) technique for creating the composite suitability maps (current and future). Under current climate, results revealed 15% of Zimbabwe as most suitable for solar projects, while 8% is predicted to be highly suitable by 2040. The findings also revealed that climate change, and projected temperature had a significant influence on future suitability. The Web-GIS demonstrated effectiveness in visualising and analysing solar site suitability.

Especially in remote areas such as the Andes of south-east Ecuador, remote sensing using satellites has been proven to provide valuable information on canopy traits. However, the performance of the multispectral models to date is limited. Here, we analyse the potential of DESIS (DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) hyperspectral surface reflectance data for the prediction of specific leaf area (SLA), foliar toughness, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content by calibrating a PLSR model for each foliar trait. Model validation showed a high explanation of variance (R2 : 0.78–0.92) and a low model error (mean-normalized RMSE: 8–13%) for all traits, showing an improved performance compared to models based on multispectral imagery and ancillary data within the same forest type. Hyperspectral models predicting foliar traits from individual tree crowns showed a lower performance for most traits, probably related to the difference in spatial resolution compared to this study. Given the high species richness of the Andean biodiversity hotspot and the complex topography, the high quality of the DESIS models is remarkable, considering that the multispectral models from the region require topographic predictors in addition to reflectances to achieve a good performance. The spatial trait maps generated by our models based on the reflectances only show clear relationships with terrain elevation. Thus, the hyperspectral trait maps from satellite orbit are capable of supporting large-scale ecological analyses between features, diversity and ecosystem functions. © 2025 The Author(s).

This rapid change disrupts urban infrastructure, fauna, and ecosystem services. Therefore, monitoring urban growth alone is not enough, but projecting the impacts of its patterns and trends on the terrestrial ecosystems should also be considered. In this study, the Random Forest (RFs), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) technique, and Cellular Automata (CA) model have been adopted to predict urban growth patterns and their effects on barren land ecosystems in Kuwait over two decades. The RFs classifier categorised remotely sensed images (sentinel-2), producing a land use and land cover map for the study area. The findings revealed that the land-use/land-cover (LULC) map, with an accuracy of over 90 ​%, shows a rapid urban growth pattern in Kuwait, transforming 16,166 ​ha into built-up areas in the span of five years (2017–2022). The model predicts that large areas of barren land will be converted into built-up places, particularly in marginally urbanised zones in the northwest direction. Likewise, an enormous increase in urban expansion will occur along the southeast coasts and southern part of the country too. The predicted patterns of urban development, including densification and longitudinal spatial expansion, will significantly impact the urban biosphere and land ecosystems. Accordingly, the estimated urban expansion will likely cause significant destruction and fragmentation of the fragile natural habitats and ecosystems across desert land, particularly alluvial fans, dunes, valleys, ridges, and salt marshes. Our results have several vital implications and can assist decision-makers and planners in formulating sustainable urban strategies and environmental protection plans in arid and semi-arid regions. © 2025 The Authors","CA-Markov; Geospatial modelling; Kuwait; Land ecosystems; Radom forest; Urban expansion","","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007437952"

Urban expansion has led to multiple consequences, including the loss of productive agricultural lands, open green spaces and reduction of groundwater levels. Objective: The goal of this study is to integrate remote sensing and machine learning technologies to examine the decline of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip caused by urban expansion. The use of satellite imagery provides detailed data to better understand these changes, particularly when a variety of satellite images spanning multiple periods are used. Methods: The study employed an analysis of six different satellite images captured every 10 years from 1970 to 2020. The findings were used to predict land use for 25 centers in Gaza Strip in 2030. Results: The analysis of satellite images by utilizing controlled classification produced a set of data and tables showing the evolution of the urban expansion across the periods of 1970-2020. Using this data, two models were employed to predict the areas of urban and agricultural use up to 2030: the Markov chains model and a regression model using the random forest algorithm. The predictions of the random forest were very close to that of the Markov model, indicating the efficiency of the algorithm. Conclusion: The study revealed a significant and rapid increase in urbanization in city centers, which was estimated to be around 28.9 km2 by 2030. While in more rural areas, there was an increase in annual growth at the expense of agricultural land, particularly in the eastern and western regions of the Gaza Strip. © 2025 Israa University.

Torrential monsoonal rain from May to September 2020 produced a severe flood that became catastrophic for Assam. Changes in the distributional patterns of monsoonal rainfall result in irregularities in the state of Assam's tropical flood occurrence, duration, and intensity. This chapter assesses the flood situation in Assam using the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B SAR images in combination with other ancillary datasets such as precipitation, ground-based river gauge data, and gridded population data. Seventy-five pre-flood and 106 post-flood images were processed within the Google Earth Engine platform for developing the flood model. Difference and pixel-by-pixel ratio change method are used to highlight the flood occurrence patterns and trends across various land use and landforms within the state. Seasonality of flood and its duration were the main concerns. Three long and heavy spells of rain triggered three distinct flood phases. The river Brahmaputra and its tributaries flowed above danger level for almost all the flood phases. In the second phase, all experienced the most noticeably awful flooding scenarios. The result suggests that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is more effective for mapping floods from space than optical data because SAR data can capture images in any weather situation. The developed flood model indicates that around 12.27 lakh hectares (ha) of land were flooded, over 3650 villages were under water, and more than 20 lakh people were directly affected.

These diseases continue to re-emerge, likely due to changes in vector ecology, urbanization, human migration, and larger range of climatic suitability. Recent shifts in landscape and weather variables are predicted to impact the habitat patterns of urban mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Miami, FL is in the tropical zone, while Charleston, SC is in the humid subtropical zone, and both cities are established hotspots for arboviruses. We applied remote sensing with land-use cover and weather variation to identify mosquito infestation patterns. We detected statistically significant positive and negative associations between entomological indicators and most weather variables in combined data from both cities. For all entomological indices, weekly wind speed and relative humidity were significantly positively associated, while precipitation and maximum temperature were significantly negatively associated.

The decrease of UGI, especially natural forest and artificial forest, may reduce the diversity of ecosystem services and the ability of Kuala Lumpur to build resilience in the future. This study analyzed land use and land cover (LULC) and UGI changes in Kuala Lumpur based on Landsat satellite images in 1990, 2005, and 2021and employed the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient to assess classification accuracy. LULC was categorized into six main types: natural forest, artificial forest, grassland, water body, bare ground, and built-up area. Satellite images in 1990, 2005, and 2021 showed the remarkable overall accuracy values of 91.06%, 96.67%, and 98.28%, respectively, along with the significant Kappa coefficient values of 0.8997, 0.9626, and 0.9512, respectively. Then, this study utilized Cellular Automata and Markov Chain model to analyze the transition of different LULC types during 1990–2005 and 1990–2021 and predict LULC types in 2050. The results showed that natural forest decreased from 15.22% to 8.20% and artificial forest reduced from 18.51% to 15.16% during 1990–2021. Reductions in natural forest and artificial forest led to alterations in urban surface water dynamics, increasing the risk of urban floods. However, grassland showed a significant increase from 7.80% to 24.30% during 1990–2021. Meanwhile, bare ground increased from 27.16% to 31.56% and built-up area increased from 30.45% to 39.90% during 1990–2005. In 2021, built-up area decreased to 35.10% and bare ground decreased to 13.08%, indicating a consistent dominance of built-up area in the central parts of Kuala Lumpur. This study highlights the importance of integrating past, current, and future LULC changes to improve urban ecosystem services in the city. © 2024 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Cellular Automata and; cover (LULC) changes; Infrastructure (UGI); Land use and land; Markov Chain model; services; Urban ecosystem; Urban Green; Urbanization","cellular automaton; infrastructure; land cover; land use change; Landsat; Markov chain; satellite imagery; urban ecosystem; urbanization; Kuala Lumpur [Kuala Lumpur (ADS)]; Kuala Lumpur [West Malaysia]; Malaysia; West Malaysia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212569913"

Yet, little has been done to document the region’s rapid deforestation, assess its effects and consequences, or project future forest cover loss to aid in effective planning. Here we applied the Random Forest (RF) supervised classification algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map and quantify decadal changes in forest cover and land use (LCLU) in the Congo Basin between 1990 and 2020. We cross-validated our LCLU maps with existing global land cover products, and projected our validated results to 2050 under three climate change scenarios, using the Multiperceptron Artificial Neural Network and Markov chain algorithms of the Idrissi Land Change modeller from TerrSet. We found that, over 5.2% (215,938 km2), 1.2% (50,046 km2), and a 2.1% (86,658 km2) of dense forest cover were lost in the Congo Basin between 1990–2000, 2000–2010, and 2010–2020, totaling approximately 8.5% (352,642 km2) loss estimated between 1990–2020. For the period 2020–2050, we estimated a projected 3.7–4.0% (174,860–204,161 km2) loss in dense forest cover under all three climate change scenarios (i.e., 174,860 km2 loss projected for SSP1-2.6, 199,608 km2 for SSP2-4.5, and 204,161 km2 for SSP5-8.5), suggesting that approximately 12.3–12.6% (527,502 km2–556,803 km2) of dense forest cover could be lost over a 60-year period (1990–2050). Our study represents a novel application of spatial modeling tools and Machine Learning algorithms for assessing long-term deforestation and forest degradation within the Congo Basin, under human population growth and IPCC climate change scenarios. We provide spatial and quantitative results required for supporting long-term deforestation and forest degradation monitoring within Congo Basin countries, especially under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) REDD+ (Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program. © 2024 Yuh et al.

Forest loss rates have remained persistent throughout the region during this century, resulting in a spread fragmented landscape composed of small forest fragments. However, the spatial distribution and magnitude of the proximate causes of associated land-cover change across the tropical Andes remain unclear at regional scales (e.g., provinces). Here, we combined climate, socioeconomic, and remote sensing data with machine-learning methods to model the proximate causes of forest loss across Antioquia, Colombia, where mountains dominate the landscape. We found that temperature is one of the main proximate causes of deforestation because it defines the distribution of crops and cattle (i.e., livestock) along an elevational gradient. We also detected that vegetation features and preceding deforestation predict current deforestation increasing our ability to identify proximate causes of deforestation. Additionally, there is a high influence of local-scale socioeconomic factors driving deforestation trends over the last decade, providing evidence that implementing control measures and economic alternatives tailored to each region can reduce deforestation rates. Our model would be used as a valuable tool to inform decisions aimed at reducing pressure on forests. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Andean forests; Antioquia province; Forest loss; Livestock; Random forest algorithm; Remote sensing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204886340"

The use of remote sensing and GIS has helped to generate LULC thematic maps, which have proven immensely valuable in resource and land-use management, facilitating sustainable development by balancing developmental interests and conservation measures. The research utilized socio-economic and spatial variables such as slope, elevation, distance from streams, distance from roads, distance from built-up areas, and distance from the center of town to determine their impact on the LULC of 2016 and 2019. The research integrates Artificial Neural Network with Cellular Automta to forecast and establish potential land use changes for the years 2025 and 2040.

Accurate measurement of how these pressures alter land cover over time, along with the projection of future changes, is crucial for sustainable management. This study aims to analyse these changes from 2010 to 2020 and predict future scenarios up to 2040 using multi-source remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Optical, radar, and topographical remote sensing data from Landsat-7, Landsat-8, ALOS/PALSAR, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission derived digital elevation models (DEMs) were integrated to perform land cover change analysis using Random Forest (RF), while Cellular Automata Artificial Neural Networks (CA-ANNs) were employed for predictive modelling. The classification model achieved overall accuracies of 93% in 2010 and 94% in both 2015 and 2020, with weighted F1 scores of 80.0%, 75.8%, and 75.7%, respectively. Validation of the predictive model yielded a Kappa value of 0.70, with an overall accuracy rate of 80%, ensuring reliable spatial predictions of future land cover dynamics. Findings reveal a 12% expansion in peatland cover, equivalent to approximately 6570 ± 308.59 hectares, despite declines in specific peatland types. Concurrently, anthropogenic land uses have increased, evidenced by an 85% rise in rubber plantations (from 30,530 ± 110.96 hectares to 56,617 ± 220.90 hectares) and a 6% reduction in natural forest cover (5965 ± 353.72 hectares). Sparse vegetation, including smallholder farms, decreased by 35% from 45,064 ± 163.79 hectares to 29,424 ± 114.81 hectares. Projections for 2030 and 2040 indicate minimal changes based on current trends; however, they do not consider potential impacts from climate change, large-scale development projects, and demographic shifts, necessitating cautious interpretation. The results highlight areas of stability and vulnerability within the understudied GAP region, offering critical insights for developing targeted conservation strategies. Additionally, the methodological framework, which combines optical, radar, and topographical data with machine learning, provides a robust approach for accurate and detailed landscape-scale monitoring of tropical peatlands that is applicable to other regions facing similar environmental challenges. © 2024 by the authors.","environmental conservation; land cover dynamics; machine learning classification; modelling; peatlands; remote sensing","Deforestation; Peat; Population statistics; Rubber plantations; Environmental conservation; Land cover; Land cover dynamic; Land-cover change; Machine learning classification; Modeling; Multi-Sources; Peat land; Predictive models; Remote-sensing; Gas industry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208462719"

In this study, taking Guangzhou, China, as an example, we used Landsat series satellite data from 1992 to 2022, classified the LULC of the study area by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, estimated the LST of the area by the mono-window algorithm, and classified the LST of the study area into five UHI intensity classes based on the normalized values of the LST, and explored the influence of the LULC on the distribution of the UHI intensity. The CA-ANN (cellular automata-artificial neural network) model in QGIS software was employed to forecast the distribution of LULC and UHI intensity in Guangzhou for 2032. The findings reveal a strong correlation between UHI intensity and LULC, with water bodies and vegetation primarily exhibiting low and sub-low temperatures, while urban areas exhibit sub-high and high temperatures. The prediction results show that, according to the current development trend, compared with 1992, the water body and vegetation cover in 2032 will decrease by 46.97% and 34.24%, the building land will increase by 263.71%, and the sub-high and high temperature areas will increase by 127.76% and 375.92%. By analysing the spatial and temporal changes in LULC and its relationship with the distribution of UHI intensity during urbanization, this study assists government administrations and urban planners in devising sensible urban development strategies and implementing effective measures to plan LULC rationally.

We conducted one of the first citywide fine-scale and landscape-scale analyses of bird–building collisions in Asia and used maximum entropy modeling (as commonly applied to species distribution modeling) in a novel way to assess the drivers of bird–building collisions in the tropical city-state of Singapore. We combined 7 years of community science observations with publicly available building and remote sensing data. Drivers of bird–building collisions varied among taxa. Some migratory taxa had a higher relative collision risk that was linked to areas with high building densities and high levels of nocturnal blue light pollution. Nonmigratory taxa had a higher collision risk in areas near forest cover. Projecting our results onto official long-term land-use plans, we predicted that future increases in bird–building collision risk stemmed from increases in blue light pollution and encroachment of buildings into forested areas and identified 6 potential collision hotspots linked to future developments. Our results suggest that bird–building collision mitigation measures need to account for the different drivers of collision for resident and migratory species and show that combining community science and ecological modeling can be a powerful approach for analyzing bird–building collision data. © 2024 Society for Conservation Biology.","bird strikes; ciencia comunitaria; colisiones con ventanas; community science; ecología urbana; golpes de aves; Maxent; Maxent; urban ecology; urbanización; urbanization; window collisions","bird; building; collision; ecological modeling; light pollution; maximum entropy analysis; migratory species; niche overlap; remote sensing; risk factor; urban forestry; urbanization; Asia; North America; Singapore; animal; biological model; city; ecosystem; environmental protection; physiology; theoretical model; Animals; Birds; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Models, Theoretical","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188275982"

This paper focuses on an empirical study analyzing causes and spatiotemporal attributes in a tropical metropolis to enrich the urban climate database. A comparative assessment of temperature patterns from Landsat and Terra satellite sensors was performed for day–night scenarios for summer and winter. Results showed that from 2003 to 2014, there was a sharp rise of about 4 °C in average daytime temperature in summer. The temporal UHI increased by 28.52% for summer and 8.37% for winter in the last two decades. The thermal hotspot development was linked to land cover dynamics using surface indices, land use land cover, and local climate zone patterns. The dense green cover was reduced by 652.69 km2,reflecting the major cause behind hotspot development. The presence of water content was reduced, as depicted by a drop in maximum NDWI values from 0.425 to 0.152. The study identified compact mid-rise building arrangements within the built area as critical for hotspot creation. Green roofing with low plants should be prioritized at such locations since it can reduce the average temperature by 2.6 °C.

In addition to urban growth and agriculture, shrimp farming has become one of the main drivers behind the loss of tropical and subtropical coastal wetlands. Despite its socio-economic importance, shrimp farming has high environmental costs worldwide. Consequently, monitoring shrimp farming at regional and local scales is essential to determine if the resulting pressure on coastal wetlands is increasing. We analyzed land use/land cover (LULC) in the Bahía Santa Maria-La Reforma (BSMR) lagoon system in northwestern Mexico using remote sensing data to determine landscape and surface cover changes. We also projected future scenarios based on stochastic models and evaluated landscape metrics considering the effects of shrimp farming. Four LULC thematic maps (1985, 1994, 2002, and 2017) with overall accuracy values > 80% and two projected maps (2027 and 2037) were produced. Agriculture was the dominant LULC class in the BSMR coastal lagoon system, although saltmarshes appear to be the most critical wetland type in the area. Shrimp farming, which was nonexistent in 1985, represented 4% of the total landscape in 2017. By 2037, this value is expected to increase to 5%. Saltmarshes showed negative trends due to the expansion of shrimp farming. Considering the importance of wetlands given their ecosystem services, this study highlights LULC changes due to economic activities and the need to improve management strategies to protect the wetlands of the BSMR coastal lagoon system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal wetland; Land use/land cover change (LULCC); Landsat; Landscape metric; Markov chain; Shrimp farming","coastal lagoon; coastal wetland; land use change; Landsat; Markov chain; remote sensing; shrimp fishery; urban growth; Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190871012"

Integrated landscape approaches are promoted to negotiate trade-offs between competing land uses and their reconciliation. Incorporating local perceptions of landscape dynamics as basis for such negotiations is particularly relevant for sub-Saharan Africa, where most people depend on natural ecosystems for livelihoods and well-being. This study applied participatory scenario building and spatially explicit simulation to unravel perceptions of the potential impact of rubber and settlement expansion on the provision of selected ecosystem services in southwestern Ghana under a business-as-usual scenario. We collected data in workshops and expert surveys on locally relevant ecosystem services, their indicator values, and the probable land-use transitions. The data was translated into an assessment matrix and integrated into a spatially explicit modeling platform, allowing visualization and comparison of the impact on ecosystem service provision of land-use scenarios under rubber plantation and settlement expansion. The results show the capacity of current (2020) and future land-use patterns to provide locally relevant ecosystem services, indicating a decline in capacity of ecosystem service provisioning in the future compared to the 2020 land-use patterns, a threat to the benefits humans derive from ecosystems. This highlights urgent need for policies and measures to control the drivers of land-use/land-cover change. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of diversifying land-use/land-cover types for sustainable landscape development. The paper contributes new insights into how spatially explicit and semi-quantitative methods can make stakeholder perceptions of landscape dynamics explicit as a basis for implementing integrated landscape approaches. © The Author(s) 2024.","Ghana; GISCAME modeling; Integrated landscape approaches; Landscape dynamics; Participatory scenario development; Perceptions","Data visualization; Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Quality of service; Rubber; Ecosystem services; Ghana; GISCAME modeling; Integrated landscape approach; Land use pattern; Land-use land-cover changes; Landscape dynamics; Participatory scenario development; Scenario development; Service provisions; Land use; fuel; rubber; assessment method; ecosystem service; future prospect; integrated approach; land cover; land use change; landscape structure; participatory approach; perception; scenario analysis; service provision; spatial analysis; Article; cellular automaton; cooking; cropland; data analysis; ecosystem health; environmental policy; forest; fruit; futurology; geographic information system; household; human; human settlement; land use; landscape; mangrove; multi criteria evaluation; palm vegetation; planning; plantation; probability; remote sensing; scrub; Shannon index; simulation; tree; tropical rain forest; vegetation; waterbody; wetland; wild meat; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; Sub-Saharan Africa; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184835108"

Thus, one of the most noticeable effects of uncontrolled urban expansion is urban sprawl. As a result, land cover and land use are rapidly changing in cities of developing countries. This article investigates the change in the LU/LC pattern for the period of 1991 and 2021 and simulates the pattern during 2031, 2041, 2051, and 2100 in Kolkata Urban Agglomeration (KUA). It also examines the flow of people inside the Kolkata Urban Agglomeration in order to address the issue of the rapidly increasing rate of urbanization. The mapping of LU/LC patterns from Landsat datasets has been done using the k-means clustering technique. Subsequently, the research used an integrated cellular automata Markov model in combination with TerrSet to predict and model possible land-use/cover scenarios. Using a number of key influencing factors, the study attempts to forecast future urban growth. It has been found in simulated maps that the natural vegetation and agricultural land will continue to decrease between 2021 and 2100.It has also been predicted that the built-up area may be increased from 550.66 km2 in 2021 to 682.51 km2 in 2100.Relative entropy statistics show that urban sprawl in the KUA has grown faster than expected during the past three decades, which indicates that the log n value was recorded as 0.6021, the highest significant value 0.1579 in 2021, and the lowest value was 0.141 in 1991. Nonetheless, emigration to neighbouring areas has resulted in a decrease in Kolkata's population density. Additional support for the model's applicability as a study field description is provided by the kappa coefficient of 0.8. The study's findings contribute to our understanding of urban sprawl, land-use/land-cover dynamics, and future projections. Furthermore, they offer crucial data for planning and decision-making processes, encouraging sustainable land use management and guiding strategies for prudent urban growth in the study area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Cellular Automata; Land use /land cover Change; Out-migration; Shannon's entropy; Urban expansion","agglomeration; artificial neural network; cellular automaton; decision making; land use change; land use planning; Landsat; population density; urban development; urban growth; urbanization; India; Kolkata; West Bengal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188830272"

Soil erosion is one of the most important environmental challenges today, particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia. The objective of this study was evaluating the dynamics of soil loss, quantifying sediment yield, and detecting soil erosion hotspot fields in the Boyo watershed. To quantify the soil erosion risks, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was used combined with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology, with land use/land cover, rainfall, soil, and management approaches as input variables. The sediment yield was estimated using the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) method. In contrast to a loss in forest land (1.7 %), water bodies (3.0 %), wetlands (1.5 %), and grassland (1.7 %), the analysis of LULC change (1991–2020) showed a yearly increase in the area of cultivated land (1.4 %), built-up land (0.8 %), and bare land (3.5 %). In 1991, 2000, and 2020, respectively, the watershed's mean annual soil loss increases by 15.5, 35.9, and 38.3 t/ha/y. Approximately 36 cm of the watershed's economically productive topsoil was lost throughout the study's twenty-nine-year period (1991–2020). According to the degree of erosion, 16 % of the watershed was deemed seriously damaged, while 70 % was deemed slightly degraded. Additionally, it is estimated for the year 2020 that 74,147.25 t/y of sediment (8.52 % of the total annual soil loss of 870,763.12 t) reach the Boyo watershed outlet.

Mangrove forests grow in tropical coastal areas and are one of the most vulnerable and endangered ecosystems in the world. Land use changes generally affect the integrity of these natural ecosystems and also lead to habitat conversion and pose a threat to plant and animal life. The direct consequences of these changes and their effects include a decrease in the health and area of ​​mangrove forests, intensification of global warming and climate change, a decrease in coastal water quality, a decrease in biodiversity, fragmentation of coastal habitats, and the destruction of biological resources. Therefore, spatio-temporal monitoring of land use changes and modeling and predicting the trend of these changes can contribute to integrated management and proper planning in mangrove forests. Accordingly, in the present study, the spatial-temporal changes in land use of Khamir and Qeshm mangrove forests during the years 1989-2023 were investigated. In addition, to model and predict the trend of these changes, a combined CA-ANN model was investigated based on the descriptive variables of altitude, slope, population density, distance from settlements, distance from city center, and distance from roads for the year 2060. Materials and Methods: Khamir and Qeshm mangrove forests (Hara Protected Area) with an area of ​​86,258 ha located in Hormozgan province. In this study, the spatial-temporal changes in land use in this region were investigated using a set of Landsat satellite images (1989-2023) in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) web-based system. In addition, to model and predict these changes, a combined artificial neural network and cellular automata (CA-ANN) model was examined based on descriptive variables of altitude, slope, population density, distance from settlements, distance from city center, and distance from roads, and a map of the possible trend of land use changes for the year 2060 was also prepared. Finally, the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model was used to analyze the impact of these variables on the trend of land use changes in the region. Results and Discussion: According to the results, the mangrove forests of Khamir and Qeshm show a decreasing trend in 2023 compared to 1989. The results of the prediction of land use changes also showed that tidal zones and bare lands will increase in 2060, while mangrove forests and aquatic areas will decrease. Also, the most significant changes are related to the reduction of mangrove forests (in the northern and southeastern regions of the region) and the increase of other unnatural areas (tidal zones and bare lands in the area of ​​Bandar Khamir in the north and northeast of the region, as well as on the outskirts of the villages of Laft to Goran). Accordingly, considering the values ​​of the probability of transition, mangrove forest covers are susceptible to transformation into other unnatural areas. In addition, the results of the regression model analysis showed that the most important descriptive variables affecting land use changes include distance from settlements and roads due to greater accessibility and the possibility of high development of human activities in these natural habitats. In this regard, the continued increase in land use changes in the Khamir and Qeshm mangrove forests will lead to the destruction and extinction of a large area of ​​these valuable biological reserves in the south of the country. Conclusion: Given that the Khamir and Qeshm mangrove forests are considered areas under environmental protection and management boundaries, the implementation of proposed projects and the construction of any infrastructure and development in this area must be carried out by management plans (zoning) and environmental assessments. On the other hand, land use changes outside the management boundaries of the area must be limited to minimize the reduction in the integrity and fragmentation of the habitat in these natural habitats. Accordingly, reducing the adverse effects of land use changes in this area requires appropriate planning and integrated management in the proper utilization of these natural resources. The findings of this study can also help stakeholders create an opportunity to develop appropriate strategies to protect the mangrove forests of Khamir and Qeshm and restore these habitats. © 2025 by the authors.","CA-ANN hybrid model; Khamir and Qeshm mangrove forests; Land use; OLS regression model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217171395"

External changes, such as wars or massive migrations, can have a great impact on the urbanization process. Nevertheless, natural resources, industrial and technological evolution as well as the form of political systems play a key role in the development and attractivity of a country and need to be taken into account when analyzing the land use dynamics and urban development. Monitoring and predicting urban growth and soil artificialization/imperviousness is hard for countries where data is scarce. Countries at stake (mainly developing countries) rarely have a good statistical system. Remote sensing (images and modeling algorithms) coupled with Geographic-Information-Systems (GIS) emerged within the last 40 years as a good tool for examining the urban evolution and land use dynamics since it enables to (1) classify land use and land cover (LULC) into urban areas (dense, mixed, peri-urban, etc.) and other classes and (2) predict the evolution of LULC via several modeling approaches: Cellular Automata (CA), Markov Chain Model (MCM), CAMCM, CAMCM based models (such as SLEUTH, Dyna-CLUE). More recently, CAMCM models are coupled with techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) such as the Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), as well as with Agent-Based-Models (ABM), etc. Two challenges are linked to the context of peri-urbanization and urban sprawl: (1) the areas of interest are mixed LULC classes (as the mix of sparse housings with green spaces, and the mix of commercial and industrial areas, etc.), where generally the confusion error is high, hence the rural-urban linkage is not presented; and (2) the urban sprawl is subject to many external factors (increase in energy prices, new mobility services, the evolution of technology). Moreover, most countries have policies and regulations to try and mitigate the urban sprawl problem. In addition to that, the temporal transition phases of LULC, including the intermediate phases, are not systematically included. This chapter reviews the main approaches to tackle these issues, via an extensive review of literature, both on the processing of raw images and on the modeling of LULC dynamics. Recent classification techniques enable to extraction of more details from the images, as well as to add semantics to the obtained classification. The evolution of sensors gives higher resolutions images that open new fields of possibility, such as 3D processing or real-time sensing. Moreover, the coupling of CAMCM with multi-criteria decision analysis allows us to better model and understand LULC evolution. This would contribute, to the assessment, monitoring, and promotion of urban sustainability indicators at regional and global scales. Results are illustrated by a case study on the Greater Beirut Agglomeration in Lebanon, where only remote sensing images are available as data sources, and on the Greater Paris region in France, where more data exist and can be used in models. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","comprehensive land use prediction; land use classification; Remote sensing technologies; semantic similarity classification; urban modeling; urban regeneration","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206205543"

In advanced industrialized nations, per-urban areas undergo social, economic, and spatial transformations, while in developing countries, they often experience disorderly urbanization leading to urban sprawl. Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) driven by human activities are crucial factors in the growth and development of urban environments. The objective of this research is to identify modifications in LULC patterns in both urban and surrounding suburban regions, with a projection of these patterns into the year 2030. The methodology incorporates the analysis of Landsat satellite data, utilizing both the Markov Chain and Cellular Automata (MC-CA) models, alongside the Artificial Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) models. The study focuses on monitoring the developmental trajectory of Shahrekord city in Iran using Landsat remote sensing data spanning from 1985 to 2015. The research employs the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and CA-Markov methodologies for training and validation across two time spans: 1985–2000 and 2000–2015. Parameters and influential factors, including proximity to roads, academic institutions, and industrial areas, are considered drivers of growth and development. The combined application of MLP and CA-Markov yields more accurate outcomes. The results demonstrate shifts in urban land use by 2030, as follows: urban green space will increase from 537 to 590 ha, built-up areas will expand from 2168 to 3143 ha, agricultural lands will decrease from 4327 to 3908 ha, and barren land will shrink from 1576 to 968 ha. This geospatial artificial intelligence model accurately forecasts urban and peri-urban changes. Such land change modeling holds the potential to assist decision makers in addressing issues related to urban sprawl. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence; CA-Markov; Land Change Modeler (LCM); Land Use/Land Cover (LULC); Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); peri-urbanization; remote sensing data","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206152420"

Landfills pose a severe environmental threat to the local ecosystem. Metropolitan cities in most developing countries usually have multiple landfills. Landfill Land surface temperature (LST) monitoring can help keep track of the changes in landfills, especially concerning waste management, land use, hotspot movement, fire prediction and the stability of the landfill. Monitoring these waste disposal sites through remote sensing data can provide real-time monitoring and analysis, supporting quick interventions when necessary. This research utilizes LANDSAT 8 satellite images for Mumbai, India. Using geospatial analysis, image processing and data processing, LST is derived for 576 LST data points. While landfill LST has a positive trend over time, but there are cyclical, seasonal and changes due to disruptive events. With landfill LST consistently remaining the highest over the years, in comparison to built-up, green and sea LSTs. A statistical analysis of the data reveals the overall significance of the model in ascertaining the increase in temperature due to the presence of landfills.

Three Community Development (CD) Blocks, namely, Contai-I, Deshapran, and Ramnagar-II were considered to analyze the growth pattern of the area under CBA. Landsat datasets of the assessment years (1991, 2001, 2011, 2021, and 2023) were used to prepare the land use/ land cover (LULC) maps and to derive pertinent landscape metrics of patch and class levels for this region. This brought forward a highly fragmented and dispersive spatial concentration of the CBA farms in the entire study area. Additionally, Census Village-wise growth pattern of CBA was analyzed by conducting a spatial autocorrelation analysis which depicted prominent clustering of villages with a higher concentration of CBA. Results showed that there has been an incessant growth of CBA in the last three decades, however, a sharp drop has been recorded owing to recurrent bouts of diseases, swelling production costs, and a sharp drop-in market rate. The nature of growth and/ or decay of the CBA was predicted for the year 2025 using Cellular Automata and Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model. After careful calibration and validation, the model projected further lessening of the CBA area along with a continued expansion of abandoned aquaculture. Accordingly, ecologically viable livelihood alternatives and environmentally sustainable management measures were suggested for the efficient monitoring of these highly fragile tropical ecosystems. © 2024 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

Two methods were employed: the traditional approach estimating the Atmospheric Urban Heat Island (UHI) using air temperature data, and the quantiles method assessing the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) through medium spatial resolution images. The findings demonstrate the existence of an average heat island effect, as estimated by both UHI (+0.9 °C) and SUHI (+2.03 °C). The intensity of the atmospheric UHI is linked with higher air temperature values around midday. Additionally, the study reveals that UHI values in the MRV are more pronounced during spring and summer SUHI estimates peak during the summer months. The utilization of orbital remote sensing enables the identification of hotspots throughout the metropolitan area, with the highest temperatures observed in industrial areas, suburban neighborhoods, and densely populated regions. The advantage of the UHI method lies in its long time series, providing high temporal resolution and statistical significance over an extended period. Conversely, the SUHI method offers the advantage of considering data across the entire domain with high spatial resolution. Thus, these two methods complement each other in identifying the heat island phenomenon. © 2024 Applied Geography Conferences.","air temperature; land use and land cover; metropolitan region of Vitória; SUHI; thermal infrared sensor; UHI","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187168910"

In intact forests, even small levels of deforestation can have profound consequences for vertebrate biodiversity. The risk hotspots are Borneo, the Central Amazon, and the Congo Basin. Earth observation (EO) now provides regular, high-resolution satellite images from the Copernicus Sentinel missions and other platforms. To assess the impact of forest conversion and forest loss on biodiversity and habitat quality, forest loss in a tiger conservation landscape in Malaysia is analysed using Sentinel-2 imagery and the InVEST habitat quality model. Forest losses are identified from satellites using the random forest classification and validated with PlanetScope imagery at 3–5 m resolution for a test area. Two scenarios are simulated using InVEST, one with and one without the forest loss maps. The outputs of the InVEST model are maps of tiger habitat quality and habitat degradation in northeast Peninsular Malaysia. In addition to forest loss, OpenStreetMap road vectors and the GLC2000 land-cover map are used to model habitat sensitivity to threats from roads, railways, water bodies, and urban areas. The landscape biodiversity score simulation results fall sharply from ~0.8 to ~0.2 for tree-covered land cover when forest loss is included in the habitat quality model. InVEST makes a reasonable assumption that species richness is higher in pristine tropical forests than in agricultural landscapes. The landscape biodiversity score is used to compare habitat quality between administrative areas. The coupled EO/InVEST modelling framework presented here can support decision makers in reaching the targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Forest loss information is essential for the quantification of habitat quality and biodiversity in tropical forests. Next generation ecosystem service models should be co-developed alongside EO products to ensure interoperability. © 2024 by the authors.","biodiversity; deforestation; Earth observation; ecosystem services; machine learning","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision making; Ecosystems; Interoperability; Machine learning; Observatories; Satellites; Tropics; Congo basins; Earth observations; Ecosystem services; Forest loss; Habitat quality; Hotspots; Machine-learning; Malaysia; Quality modeling; Tropical forest; Deforestation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183317286"

Therefore, this study aims to examine the changes in LU/LC pattern in Delhi during 1991–2018 and simulate the future LU/LC pattern of Delhi for 2030. The LU/LC pattern mapping was done from Landsat datasets using k-means clustering technique. The cellular automata (CA) technique was integrated with artificial neural network (ANN) for simulating the future LU/LC patterns. The projected LU/LC pattern shows that Delhi’s built-up area will increase to nearly 60% of the total area of city, while cropland and open land will decrease to 19.86 and 0.15%, respectively. The highest increase in built-up area was observed in the northern, western, and south-western sub-districts of Delhi. Outcomes of the study may be used for future land use planning in Delhi and other cities.

Land use models support natural resource conservation by helping stakeholders to understand and predict these changes. Through such model-based projections, governments and conservationists can identify hotspots of encroachment and formulate informed decisions for sustainable conservation. Land use on Mount Elgon has undergone rapid changes in the conservation area and community land since the 1970s. Park encroachment has threatened natural cover due to population pressure and increasing demand for agricultural land. To support conservation efforts, this study conducted near-future potential land use change projections using historical land use change and iCLUE model simulations. This study established hotspots of land use conversion, locations of park encroachment and the extent of land use intensification in the upper Manafwa watershed of Mount Elgon. The study applied remote sensing, a geographic information system, and a land use change model (iCLUE), while considering nine land use classes to project land use change for 2030, 2040 and 2050 using a “business-as-usual” scenario. Stakeholder verification of the model output was conducted in a dedicated workshop. The results showed that in 2050, agriculture (44.24%) and low-stocked tropical high forest (22.56%) will be the largest land cover classes with bushland and shrubs as the smallest land cover classes (∼0.5%). Most of the land use conversion in the park is projected to occur along the boundary of the conservation area by agriculture and built-up areas. This study will guide stakeholders and decision makers in planning future sustainable management strategies to conserve and enhance remaining forest tracts in Mount Elgon. © 2023 The Authors","Conservation; Driving factors; iCLUE model; Land use and land cover; Mount Elgon; Stakeholders","computer simulation; conservation management; governance approach; land cover; land use change; natural resource; nature conservation; numerical model; park management; stakeholder; Mount Elgon","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173503901"

The rapid loss of tropical rainforests is threatening the integrity of protected areas and connectivity in the Amazon and other natural regions. In the context of the post-conflict stage, a set of land use and land cover change scenarios were constructed for the Colombian Amazon for the year 2040, using expert coherent narratives. Three scenarios were designed: trend, extractivist, and sustainable development. Historic land use change and driving factors were analyzed throughout 14 transitions between the years 2002 and 2016, based on the interpretation of Landsat images and their relationship with 29 driving factors using artificial neural networks. The Markov chain model was calculated for the transitions, and the change allocation model was parameterized to spatially simulate the scenarios. The results showed that the LULC model calibration and validation were satisfactory (0.91). The sustainable development scenario that considers strong policies for the conservation of forests and implementation of sustainable production projects was the option with greater values for conserved forests and secondary vegetation in recovery, adding ~ 42 million hectares by 2040. The other scenarios showed that the Colombian Amazon will lose ~ 2 million hectares of forests in the trend scenario and ~ 4.3 million hectares in the extractivist scenario, based on the reference year (2016). In the trend scenario, pastures and crops could increase by 48%; and, in the extractivist scenario, these would increase by 117%, changing from ~ 3.9 to ~ 8.6 million hectares. We hope that the scientific contribution of this study will be relevant for informed discussion in decision-making and provide a framework for building a peaceful territory. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; artificial neural network; calibration; crop; decision making; forest; land use; Markov chain; nonhuman; pasture; satellite imagery; sustainable development; vegetation; agriculture; Colombia; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; rain forest; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Rainforest; Sustainable Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147567717"

Predictions of future vulnerability and forest change were based on land cover maps for 2010 and 2014 developed using the integration of Landsat, ALOS PALSAR, and Sentinel-1 data. The four main land cover classes in the region were oil palm and rubber plantations, native forests, and non-forested areas. The performance of the WNL–MC model was evaluated by comparing the simulated and actual land cover maps for 2018 and validating them against high-resolution images. Kappa accuracy for the simulated maps was >85%, and overall accuracy was >90%. Under the scenario of no forest conservation, native forest showed approximately 50% loss over the next 30 years, while the forest conservation scenario showed a slowing of current deforestation by 18% from 2018 to 2030 and by 5.95% from 2030 to 2050. Native forest outside forest conservation zones was most vulnerable to conversion to other land uses, particularly in lowland areas close to settlements and roads.

Delhi National Capital Region (Delhi NCR) is an inter-state planning region, located in the central part of India. The region has attracted a larger chunk of population by providing better economic opportunities during last few decades. This has resulted in large-scale transformation of the LULC pattern in the region. Thus, this study is intended to analyze and quantify the LULC change and its drivers in the peri-urban areas of Delhi NCR using Landsat datasets. Based on an extensive literature survey, several potential drivers of the LULC change have been analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) for the Delhi NCR. The results from LULC classification showed that the built-up area has increased from 1.67 to 7.12% of the total area of Delhi NCR during 1990–2018 while other LULC types have declined significantly. The OLS results showed that migration and employment in the tertiary sector are the most important drivers of built-up expansion in the study area. The standard residuals and local R2 results from GWR showed spatial heterogeneity among the coefficients of the explanatory variables throughout the study area.

In 2019, the Peruvian government mobilized a targeted, large-scale armed intervention against illegal ASGM, which has caused deforestation and water resource degradation in this Tropical Biodiversity Hotspot. Before the intervention, the extent of waterbodies created by mining (mining ponds) was increasing by 33%–90%/year; after, they decreased by 4%–5%/year in targeted zones. Mining activity indicators showed 70%–90% abandonment. New mining activity accelerated in nearby areas outside the targeted area (pond area increases: 42%–83%; deforestation increases +3–5 km2/year). Far from intervention zones, mining remained stable during the study period. Our analysis demonstrates that targeted, large-scale government intervention can have positive effects on conservation by stopping illegal mining activity and shifting it to permitted areas, thereby setting the stage for governance. Continued conservation efforts must further address the impacts of informal mining while (1) limiting environmental degradation by legal mining; (2) remediating former mining areas to reduce erosion and enable reforestation or alternative uses of the landscape; and (3) sustaining such efforts, as some miners began to return to intervention areas when enforcement relaxed in 2022. © 2023 The Authors.

The Atlantic Forest is one of the world’s most important biodiversity hotspots, jeopar-dized by habitat loss and fragmentation. The Pernambuco Endemism Center (PEC) is the most degraded of the Atlantic Forest regions and because of the dramatic levels of deforestation, fragmentation, and ongoing species losses, studies on the distribution and configuration of the PEC’s forest cover are necessary. However, across dynamic tropical landscapes, investigating changes over time is essential because it may reveal trends in forest quality attributes. Here, we used Google Earth Engine to assess land use and land cover data from MapBiomas ranging from 1985 to 2020 to calculate current landscape metrics and to reveal for the first time the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PEC’s forests. We identified a forest cover area that ranged from 571,661 ha in 1985 to 539,877 ha in 2020, and about 90% of the fragments were smaller than 10 ha. The average fragment size was about 11 ha, and only four fragments had more than 5,000 ha. Deforestation was mostly concentrated in northern Alagoas, southern Pernambuco, and non-coastal Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. On average, borders represented 53.6% of the forests from 1985 to 2020, and younger forests covered 52.3% of the area in 2017, revealing a vegetation rejuvenation process 2.5 times higher than in total Atlantic Forest. In 2017, older forest cores in fragments larger than 1000 ha (i.e., higher-quality habitats) represented only 12% of the remaining forests. We recommend that the amount of forest cover alone may poorly assist conservation managers, and our results indicate that ensuring legal protection and increasing surveillance of the PEC’s few last higher-quality habitats is urgently needed. © 2023 Dias et al.

One key challenge for the description of associated impacts is the initial localisation of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs). This usually requires a mixture of extensive site-specific data collection and the use of geospatial datasets and remote sensing techniques. To date, no study has succeeded in identifying different types of GDEs in parallel worldwide. The main objective of this work is to perform a global screening analysis to identify GDE potentials rather than GDE locations. In addition, potential risks to GDEs from groundwater abstraction shall be identified. We defined nine key indicators that capture GDE potentials and associated risks on a global grid of 0.5° spatial resolution. Groundwater-dependent streams, wetlands and vegetation were covered, and a GDE index was formulated incorporating the following three aspects: the extent of groundwater use per GDE type, GDE diversity and GDE presence by land cover. The results show that GDE potentials are widely distributed across the globe, but with different distribution patterns depending on the type of ecosystem. The highest overall potential for GDEs is found in tropical regions, followed by arid and temperate climates. The GDE potentials were validated against regional studies, which showed a trend of increasing matching characteristics towards higher GDE potentials, but also inconsistencies upon closer analysis. Thus, the results can be used as first-order estimates only, which would need to be explored in the context of more site-specific analyses. Identified risks to GDEs from groundwater abstraction are more geographically limited and concentrated in the US and Mexico, the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb, as well as Central, South and East Asia. The derived findings on GDEs and associated risks can be useful for prioritising future research and can be integrated into sustainability-related tools such as the water footprint. © 2023 The Author(s).

Accurate simulation of future rice cultivation is challenging in the context of climate change involving spatial modeling. This study introduced a hydrological data-based prediction approach integrating cellular automata-Markov chain model with multi-criteria decision analysis. Three decadal transitions of different land use land cover (LULC) in an agricultural intensified canal irrigated area were analyzed using Random Forest algorithm. The Landsat satellite imageries were classified with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. The results revealed that the area under water sources, plantation, and fallow land decreased by 53.1%, 33.9%, and 63.6%, respectively, while habitation and Boro rice cultivated area increased significantly by 1243.3% and 211%, respectively, during 1988–2018. The kappa coefficient (0.86), allocation disagreement (10.9%), and quantity disagreement (1.16%) revealed good agreement between the predicted and classified LULC map of 2018. The probable distribution of the LULC map in 2028 and 2038 indicated 54.5% and 59.3% of the command area under Boro rice cultivation as a dominant land cover, respectively. Further, the predicted LULC map anticipated that Boro rice cultivation was likely to expand at the expense of plantation and fallow land which may lead to massive water scarcity in the near future. The proposed approach covered up the limitations of spatial modeling on agricultural growth trends by integrating significant driving factors with quantitative and spatiotemporal aspects of LULC transition. These findings will provide a baseline map for sustainable policy reformation and contemplation on the repercussions that local LULC transition has on global environmental change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Future scenario modeling; Land cover; Land use; Remote sensing; Rice cultivation","alternative agriculture; climate change; cultivation; future prospect; land cover; land use change; Landsat; plantation; remote sensing; rice; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; subtropical region; India","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129706836"

Therefore, identifying and predicting the fire susceptible areas is crucial for managing protected area networks. In this study, we investigated the factors affecting forest fires and modelled the fire susceptibility in a human-dominated landscape in the central Western Ghats, India, by employing remote sensing, geographic information systems and machine learning techniques. We used six machine learning models (MLMs), including artificial neural network, random forest, generalized linear model, maximum entropy, multivariate adaptive regression splines, gradient boosting machine and the ensemble model, to relate the occurrence data of fires to 14 predictor variables categorized as climate, topography, vegetation, and anthropogenic disturbances to generate fire susceptibility maps. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), true skill statistic (TSS) curves, accuracy and continuous Boyce index (CBI) were used to assess the model's accuracy. We found that all models achieved acceptable performance while validating the independent test data. However, ensemble model had the best overall performance with an AUC-ROC = 0.93; TSS = 0.72; ACCURACY = 0.89; and CBI = 0.95. The land-use and land-cover, and the distance to the agricultural fields and settlements were the key determinants of fire occurrences in the study area based on the ensemble model. The results showed that the landscape has a high to very high fire risk for about 26.5% of the total area. Forest fires have mostly occurred in the northeastern regions of the landscape, which are dominated by deciduous forests and plantations, whereas western regions are less susceptible to fires. Finally, we developed an ensemble-based fire susceptibility map with a resolution of 10 m that may be used as a tool for the prevention of forest fires. Further, it aids the relevant authorities in mitigating the disastrous effects and safeguarding the environment. The results demonstrated that ensemble-based MLMs can be employed effectively for fire prediction in other regions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Biomod2; blockCV; Ensemble model; Forest fire susceptibility modeling; Geospatial analysis; Tropical forest; Wildfires","Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Land use; Machine learning; Neural networks; Topography; Tropics; Biomod2; Blockcv; Ensemble models; Forest fire susceptibility modeling; Forest fires; Geo-spatial analysis; Machine learning models; Tropical forest; Western ghats; Wildfire; Fires; biodiversity; forest fire; GIS; image resolution; landscape; machine learning; management; prediction; protected area; regression; risk; Forecasts; Land Use; Neural Networks; India; Western Ghats","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154606385"

There is a need to identify, protect, restore and connect remaining green spaces in the urban matrix before this opportunity is lost to urban development. The objective of this study is to characterise ecological connectivity for mammals and identify important patches and linkages for connecting urban green spaces for Greater Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia. We first map land cover across the region using a linear mixture model with preprocessed multidate cloud-free mosaics derived from Sentinel 2 remote sensing data in Google Earth Engine. We then model connectivity using the land cover maps, expert-based parameterisation of Euclidian distance and graph-based connectivity models for a range of dispersal guilds representing small and medium terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our analysis showed large differences in the effects of fragmentation within Greater KL on the different dispersal groups, with some groups perceiving the landscape as disconnected. However, our analysis identified a network of green patches and pathways which potentially could support connectivity in the urban landscape.

The objective of this study was to detect changes in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and removals associated with land use and land cover changes in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) through the analysis of multispectral satellite images from 2009 to 2019. The Gross Primary Production (GPP) and CO<inf>2</inf>Flux variables were estimated by the MODIS sensor onboard Terra and Aqua satellite, representing carbon absorption by vegetation during the photosynthesis process. Atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentration was estimated from the GOSAT satellite. The variables GPP and CO<inf>2</inf>Flux showed the effective flux of carbon in the BLA to atmosphere, which were weakly correlated with precipitation (r = 0.191 and 0.133). The forest absorbed 211.05 TgC annually but, due to its partial conversion to other land uses, the loss of 135,922.34 km2 of forest area resulted in 5.82 TgC less carbon being absorbed. Pasture and agriculture, which comprise the main land conversions, increased by 100,340.39 km2 and absorbed 1.32 and 3.19 TgC less, and emitted close to twice more, than forest in these areas. Atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations increased from 2.2 to 2.8 ppm annually in BLA, with hotspots observed in the southeast Amazonia, and CO<inf>2</inf> capture by GPP showed an increase over the years, mainly after 2013, in the north and west of the BLA. This study brings to light the carbon dynamics, by GPP and CO<inf>2</inf>Flux models, as related to the land use and land cover in one of the biggest world carbon reservoirs, the Amazon, which is also important to fulfillment of international agreements signed by Brazil to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services in the region. © 2023 by the authors.","carbon dioxide flux; google earth engine; GOSAT; gross primary production; MODIS","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Laws and legislation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Atmospheric CO 2; Carbon dioxide flux; CO 2 concentration; Google earth engine; Google earths; GOSAT; Greenhouse gas emissions; Gross primary production; Land use and land cover; MODIS; Carbon dioxide","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161615757"

Understanding the correlation among land-use/cover and water quality parameters is vital for future water quality management. In this work, land-use/cover pattern and its effect on water quality in the Mindu Dam drainage area were analysed using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques together with cellular automata–Markov model. The land-use/cover images between 1990 and 2020 were used to assess historical and spatial change of land-use/ cover change, and projected for 2030 and 2040. We discovered that the dynamics of land use and land cover during the study period were significant. A strong correlation was revealed between changes in the land-use/cover and water quality parameters. Furthermore, a strong correlation exists between cultivated land and measured nutrient (nitrate and phosphate) and chlorophyll-a concentration. The natural vegetation buffer around Mindu Dam should be sufficient to prevent long-term water quality degradation from agricultural runoff in order to manage water quality sustainably.

However, in most developing countries, a spatiotemporal evaluation of urban growth is still lacking. Maseru, Lesotho’s capital and largest city, is growing rapidly due to various socioeconomic and demographic driving forces. However, urban expansion in developing countries has been characterized by entangled structures and trends exacerbating numerous negative consequences such as ecological degradation, the loss of green space, and pollution. Understanding the urban land use and land cover (LULC) dynamic is essential to mitigate such adverse impacts. This study focused on mapping and quantifying the urban extension in Maseru, using Landsat imagery from 1988 to 2019, based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. We also simulated and predicted LULC changes for the year 2050 using the cellular automata model of an artificial neural network (ANN-CA). Our results showed a notable increase in the built-up area from 15.3% in 1988 to 48% in 2019 and bare soil from 12.3% to 35.3%, while decreased agricultural land (21.7 to 1.7%), grassland (43.3 to 10.5%) and forest vegetation (5.5 to 3.2%) were observed over the study period. The classified maps have high accuracy, between 88% and 95%. The ANN-CA projections for 2050 show that built-up areas will continue to increase with a decrease in agricultural fields, bare soil, grasslands, water bodies and woody vegetation.

Therefore, we spatially quantified the changes in ecosystem services in tropical China in the past twenty years by remote sensing and InVEST model. The driving forces were further investigated by using Geodetector. We found that: 1) in the past twenty years, the area of evergreen broad-leaved forests, coniferous forests, and rubber forests have increased by 13.01%, 43.39%, and 101.23%, respectively. The shrublands and agricultural lands are the major contributors to these increased areas; 2) with the area increasing of forests, carbon storage and soil retention have increased by 9.40% and 0.30%, while nitrogen export and water yield have decreased by 43.30%, and 12.27%. This pattern of increase in carbon storage and soil retention was found in the highlands, while not in the lowlands, where large areas of evergreen broad-leaved forests have been converted to rubber forests; 3) NDVI was highly correlated to the carbon storage (q value = 0.201) and nitrogen export (q value = 0.109), while slope and precipitation mainly affected the soil retention (q value = 0.253) and water yield (q value = 0.073), respectively.

Despite a complex history of multiple colonial rules, war, rapid economic development and societal growth, Vietnam was one of a few Southeast Asian countries to reverse deforestation trends and sustain net forest cover gain since the 1990s. However, a considerable amount of Vietnam’s forest gain has been from plantation forestry, as Vietnam’s policies have promoted economic development. In the Central Highlands region of Vietnam, widespread forest degradation and deforestation has occurred recently in some areas due to plantation forestry and other factors, including fire-linked deforestation, but protected areas here have been largely effective in their conservation goals. We studied deforestation, wildfires, and the contribution of fire-linked deforestation from 2001 to 2020 in an area near the Da Lat Plateau of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. We stratified our study area to distinguish legally protected areas and those in the surrounding landscape matrix without formal protection. Using satellite-derived data, we investigated four questions: (1) Have regional deforestation trends continued in parts of the Central Highlands from 2001 to 2020? (2) Based on remotely sensed fire detections, how has fire affected the Central Highlands and what proportion of deforestation is spatiotemporally linked to fire? (3) Were annual deforestation and burned area lower in protected areas relative to the surrounding land matrix? (4) Was the proportion of fire-linked deforestation lower in protected areas than in the matrix? To answer these questions, we integrated the Global Forest Change and FIRED VIETNAM datasets. We found that 3794 fires burned 8.7% of the total study area and 13.6% of the area became deforested between 2001 and 2020. While nearly half of fires were linked to deforestation, fire-linked deforestation accounted for only a small part of forest loss. Across the entire study area, 54% of fire-linked deforestation occurred in natural forests and 46% was in plantation forests. Fire ignitions in the study area were strongly linked to the regional dry season, November to March, and instrumental climate data from 1971 to 2020 showed statistically significant increasing trends in minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures. However, the total area burned did not have a significant increasing trend. Regional trends in deforestation continued in Vietnam’s Central Highlands from 2001 to 2020, and nearly half of all detected fires can be spatially and temporally linked to forest loss. However, protected areas in the region effectively conserved forests relative to the surrounding landscape. © 2023 by the authors.","deforestation; fire; national parks; remote sensing; spatial; tropical forest; Vietnam","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154589966"

For example, the Colombian Pacific Coast (CPC), a biodiversity hotspot, is home to mangrove forests that provide environmental services to local communities. This study utilized robust multi-sensor and multi-annual satellite data, combined with machine learning in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, to improve the detection of mangrove forests in the CPC. Satellite images from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 missions were utilized along with L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) to quantify changes in mangrove cover between 2009 and 2019. Optical indices and SAR textures were used to identify mangrove cover, and a Random Forest supervised machine learning algorithm was applied for image classification. The multisensory composites produced moderate to high overall accuracies (OA) classifications. Our findings indicate that between 2009 (155,394.3 ha) and 2019 (144,704.3 ha), there was a net reduction of 6.88% in mangrove forest cover in the CPC.

However, urban expansion in towns and cities of the developing world has been characterized by entangled structures and trends exacerbating numerous negative consequences such as pollution, ecological degradation, loss of agricultural land and green areas, and deprived settlements. Substantially, spatial simulation of urban growth and their consequences on coastal areas particularly in Egypt is still very rare. Geospatial modelling coastal urban growth is crucial and has enormous potential for coastal land use transformation and urban sustainability. The key aim of this study was to analyze spatiotemporal changes (2010–2020) and simulate future dynamics (2030 to 2050) of land use/land cover (LULC) in Alexandria Governorate, Egypt. Artificial Neural Network–Multiple Layer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) and Markov Chain techniques were employed within the GIS platform to assess processes of land transitions and predict urban growth trends, patterns and dimensions. The forecasting process was based on three maps of LULC derived from classified Landsat images of 2000, 2010 and 2020. In addition, topographical, demographic, accessibility, proximity factors were generated and developed in the form of raster spatial parameters of urbanization driving forces. The findings revealed that the observed expansion of the built-up area during one decade (2010–2020) was 12,477.51 ha, with a decline in agricultural area (7440.39 ha) and bare land (4904.91 ha). The projected change was forecasted to be 71,544 ha by 2030 and 81,983 ha in 2040 with a total of 35,998 ha increase in the built-up area and residential expansion by 2050. Despite this expected pattern of rapid changes, urban growth will be shaped by the key drivers of proximity to coastline and agricultural land transformation. The analysis indicates that the vertical urban growth will be most likely dominant along the coastal zone due to the lack of vacant lands, whereas the horizontal urban expansion will primarily take place towards the east-northeastern and south-southeastern directions of the city. The present work provides a holistic framework for establishing initial coastal land use plans not only for planners and urban administrators in Alexandria but also for policymakers and coastal municipalities in developing nations. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; coastal cities; GIS; Markov Chain; monitoring; urban growth","Agriculture; Coastal zones; Developing countries; Expansion; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Land use; Markov processes; Multilayer neural networks; Population statistics; Agricultural land; Alexandria; Built-up areas; Coastal area; Coastal cities; Coastal lands; Driving forces; Land use/land cover; Urban expansion; Urban sprawl; Urban growth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147973712"

Passive acoustic sensors open the possibility of remotely sensing fauna on large spatial and temporal scales, improving our understanding of the current state of biodiversity and the effects of human influences. Acoustic indices have been widely used and tested in recent years, with an aim towards understanding the relationship between indices and the acoustic activity of several taxa in different types of environments. However, studies have shown divergent relationships between acoustic indices and the vocal activity of most soniferous taxa. A combination of indices has, in turn, been reported as a promising tool for representing biodiversity in different contexts. We used uni- and bivariate models to test different combinations of 8 common indices in relation to bird assemblage metrics. We recorded twenty-two study sites in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and three different types of environments in each site (forest, pasture, and swamp). Our results showed that 1) the best acoustic indices for explaining bird richness, abundance, and diversity were Bioacoustic and Acoustic Complexity; 2) the type of environment (forest, pasture, and swamp) influenced the performance of acoustic indices in explaining bird biodiversity, with the highest score model (biggest R2 value) being a combination between Acoustic Diversity and Bioacoustic indices. Our results do support the use of acoustic indices in monitoring the acoustic activity of birds, but combining indices is encouraged since it provided the best results. However, given the divergence we found across environments, we recommend that sets of indices are tested to determine which of them best describe the biodiversity pattern models for a specific habitat. Based on our results, we propose that biodiversity patterns can be predicted through acoustic patterns. However, the level of confidence will depend on the acoustic index used and on focal taxa of interest (i.e., birds, amphibians, insects, and mammals). © © 2023 Gaspar, D. A.

Over the past few decades, developing countries have faced the adverse effects of this phenomenon, in ecosystems lacking sustainable development. Urbanisation is generally witnessed predominantly in the urban fringes. Thoothukudi city, a sea gateway of Tamil Nadu, has been experiencing urbanisation in recent years. The objective of this work was to develop a prediction model by characterising the trend of sprawl taking place in urban environments of the city. Land use/land cover (LULC) maps were prepared for the years 2009, 2013, and 2017 from LANDSAT series datasets. A maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used for classification and the accuracy was assessed. Land use analysis of Thoothukudi city revealed that the urban area had increased from 16% in 2009 to 39% in 2017, with an overall increase of 23%. The vegetation decreased from 48% in 2009 to 24% in 2017 and, similarly, water bodies decreased from 26% in 2009 to 24% in 2017. The CA-MARKOV model was used to study the trend and to predict the LULC change. The model was validated for the year 2017 and the land use was predicted for the year 2021. The predicted result showed that the urban area would increase from 16% in 2009 to 46% in 2021 due to rapid urbanisation in the fringes of the city. The results obtained provide urban planners and decision-makers with important spatial information for formulating future development strategies that could control or minimise negative impacts on the urban environment. © 2023 CRC Press.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163556343"

This study aimed at identifying, classifying and quantifying the changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC) during the last two decades (2000–2020) and predict the decadal pattern for the next three decades (2030–2050), with particular emphasis on urban sprawl at the expense of cultivated land in the upper Awash basin of central Ethiopia. Methods: Landsat images were used to analyze the LULC change dynamics using hybrid image classification and maximum likelihood classifier techniques. The Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CAMC) Model was used to predict its future LULC change dynamics. A detailed analysis of the urban sprawl in the cities of Addis Ababa, Adama, and Mojo was also conducted. Results: It was observed that during the last two decades, settlements, particularly urban sprawls, substantially expanded at the expense of cultivated land, whereas the latter modestly expanded at the expense of forestland, bare land, and shrubland. From its size in 2000, the urban sprawl of Addis Ababa has grown in all directions towards cultivated land by more than six times in 2020 and is expected to become double of that by 2050 in the urban and peri-urban areas of the basin. Adama city has expanded by the same rate of 9.7% in the past two decades, while Mojo town has sprawled 9 folds between 2010 and 2020. The predicted percentage change in settlement for Addis Ababa and its neighboring districts within 22 km radius from the centroid shows a 40% expansion in 2030, 77% in 2040, and 87% in 2050 compared with the reference year 2020. Similarly, the Mojo town will expand significantly in 2030 (54%), 2040 (119%), and 2050 (by a staggering magnitude of 244%), while Adama will expand within the 12 km radius by 18%, 42%, and 117% in the next three respective decades. Discussion: The rapid cultivated land conversions in the basin may contribute to major shifts in urban and peri-urban ecological environments. Our predictive LULC change maps and urban sprawling could be useful for developing effective and sustainable land-use policies for environmental and ecological management in the upper Awash basin. 2023, Copyright © Hirpa, Adane, Asrat, Nedaw, Song, Roh and Lee.","Addis Ababa; CA-Markov; future trends; LULC; urban sprawl; urbanization","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161200280"

As a region grows, the land cover shifts from forests to agriculture and further to developed areas. Such a gradual change occurs slowly; however, understanding the land cover dynamics is essential to regional planning, especially in developing regions, including Indonesia. Despite its importance, studies on land cover changes in developing regions lack a coherent dataset, as many studies are based on ad-hoc approaches, resulting in embedded uncertainties. An example is the land cover classification using LANDSAT data in many parts of the developing countries lacking consistency. As an alternative, the MODIS dataset is a relatively new dataset produced by NASA, presenting a standardized land cover dataset with a 500×500 m resolution at global coverage. Such a standardized dataset gives consistency in land cover dynamics and future projections. This study presents the potential of MODIS and its use case in understanding land cover dynamics in an urbanizing watershed, i.e., the Majalaya Watershed in West Java, Indonesia. The study presents the use of Markov Chain Analysis in understanding the tendency of changes between land cover classes. This study also indicates future research directions to enrich the topic further. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","land cover; Majalaya watershed; Markov chain; MODIS; remote sensing","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159708920"

Maha Oya River Basin (MORB) is one of the major river basins in tropical Sri Lanka, which suffers from regular soil erosion and degradation. The current study was designed to estimate the soil erosion associated with land use changes of the MORB. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was used in calculating the annual soil erosion rates, while the Geographic Information System (GIS) was used in mapping the spatial variations of the soil erosion hazard over a 30-year period. Thereafter, soil erosion hotspots in the MORB were also identified. The results of this study revealed that the mean average soil loss from the MORB has substantially increased from 2.81 t ha−1 yr−1 in 1989 to 3.21 t ha−1 yr−1 in 2021, which is an increment of about 14.23%. An extremely critical soil erosion-prone locations (average annual soil loss > 60 t ha−1 yr−1) map of the MORB was developed for the year 2021. The severity classes revealed that approximately 4.61% and 6.11% of the study area were in high to extremely high erosion hazard classes in 1989 and 2021, respectively. Based on the results, it was found that the extreme soil erosion occurs when forests and vegetation land are converted into agricultural and bare land/farmland. The spatial analysis further reveals that erosion-prone soil types, steep slope areas, and reduced forest/vegetation cover in hilly mountain areas contributed to the high soil erosion risk (16.56 to 91.01 t ha−1 yr−1) of the MORB. These high soil erosional areas should be prioritized according to the severity classes, and appropriate land use/land cover (LU/LC) management and water conservation practices should be implemented as recommended by this study to restore degraded lands. © 2022 by the authors.","Geographic Information System (GIS); land use changes; remote sensing; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model; soil erosion","erosion rate; GIS; land use change; remote sensing; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; soil degradation; soil erosion; Sri Lanka","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146634412"

Any effort to achieve sustainable urban development should be supported by recognising and evaluating the ecological health of vegetation cover. This study investigates vegetation cover reduction and changes in the Tehran Metropolis, Iran and identifies the most important factors influencing the observed changes. The aim of this study is two-fold: first, to assess the spatio-temporal changes in vegetation cover in Tehran between 1990 and 2020, and second, to identify the factors contributing to the changes. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as an indicator of green cover. The spatial and statistical data used in this study were extracted from Landsat satellite imagery and the last approved Master Plan of Tehran (2006). Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and geographical modelling methods were employed to analyse vegetation cover in all municipal districts of the Tehran metropolis. The results show that the vegetation density in the Tehran metropolis decreased significantly (from 38,936.80 hectares to 4663.23 hectares) between 1990 and 2020. The expansion of construction lands and the increase of population density were the most significant factors affecting the reduction in vegetation cover in Tehran. In contrast, the growth of industrial units in the urban areas of Tehran had no significant relationship with vegetation cover. The results of this study can help urban planners understand the significant drivers of vegetation loss and identify appropriate interventions to prevent it. © 2022 by the authors.","green cover; Iran; NDVI; Tehran metropolis; urban development; vegetation index","Developing countries; Ecology; Economics; Population statistics; Urban growth; Vegetation; % reductions; Green cover; Iran; Normalized difference vegetation index; Rapid urbanizations; Spatial development; Tehran metropolis; Urban development; Vegetation cover; Vegetation index; Satellite imagery; developing world; ecological approach; environmental planning; industrial agglomeration; industrial development; land use change; NDVI; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; vegetation cover; vegetation index; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144608412"

Yet, despite ever-more detailed information on where deforestation occurs, how agriculture expands into forests remains unclear, which is hampered by a lack of spatially and temporally detailed reconstruction of agricultural expansion. Here, we developed and mapped a novel set of metrics that quantify agricultural frontier processes at unprecedented spatial and temporal detail. Specifically, we first derived consistent annual time series of land-use/cover to, second, describe archetypical patterns of frontier expansion, pertaining to the speed, the diffusion and activity of deforestation, as well as post-deforestation land use. We exemplify this approach for understanding agricultural frontier expansion across the entire South American Chaco (1.1 million km2), a global deforestation hotspot. Our study provides three major insights. First, agricultural expansion has been rampant in the Chaco, with more than 19.3 million ha of woodlands converted between 1985 and 2020, including a surge in deforestation after 2019. Second, land-use trajectories connected to frontier processes have changed in major ways over the 35 year study period we studied, including substantial regional variations. For instance, while ranching expansion drove most of the deforestation in the 1980s and 1990s, cropland expansion dominated during the mid-2000s in Argentina, but not in Paraguay. Similarly, 40% of all areas deforested were initially used for ranching, but later on converted to cropping. Accounting for post-deforestation land-use change is thus needed to properly attribute deforestation and associated environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions or biodiversity loss, to commodities. Finally, we identified major, recurrent frontier types that may be a useful spatial template for land governance to match policies to specific frontier situations. Collectively, our study reveals the diversity of frontier processes and how frontier metrics can capture and structure this diversity to uncover major patterns of human-nature interactions, which can be used to guide spatially-targeted policies. © 2022 The Author(s).

As the modern agriculture industry promotes rapid spatial pattern changes, modelling this phenomenon is of considerable interest to urban planners and city managers. Several methods have been developed to simulate the dynamics of land-use changes. However, the complexity of such dynamics can impede the usefulness of simulation methods. In this paper, a new cellular-automata and agent-based model (CA-ABM) is introduced into the spatial simulation and reorganisation of peri-urban areas. This simulation and predictive model uses the geographic information system platform and cellular automata tool. The basic components of this dynamic bottom-up approach are the actors in land-use development. Using six settlements from plains, hilly, and mountainous areas as examples combined with field investigation, remote sensing images, official land-use planning, and other data, this study analysed land-use evolution under the influence of farmers, developers, and government agents to illustrate the spatial simulation and land-use reorganisation mechanism of agricultural suburban settlements. Compared with previous studies, this study shows that the CA-ABM can reflect the dynamic behaviour of agents and successfully fuses peri-urban settlement attributes and spatially accurate simulation. Simultaneously, the proposed spatial optimisation mechanism provides a reference for the spatial reorganisation of agricultural suburban zones worldwide. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular automata tool; Land-use tool; Multi-agent decision-making system; Peri-urban settlement; Spatial prediction","bottom-up approach; cellular automaton; computer simulation; decision making; human settlement; land use planning; periurban area; prediction; spatial analysis; China","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135727611"

Due to the complex ecosystem-atmosphere interactions at different scales, these impacts are difficult to quantify and are poorly understood, especially in developing countries with limited ground-based observations. This study analyzed the impact of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities on ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) in India using remote sensing-based observations, correlation analysis, and Residual Trend analysis (RESTREND). Using different climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation, along with Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and NPP maps, we first classified the ecosystems (ES) into two categories: natural ecosystems – influenced only by climate change (ES<inf>c</inf>), covering about 19.7% of the area, and human-influenced ecosystems – influenced by both climate change and anthropogenic activities (ES<inf>c+a</inf>), covering about 80.3% of the area. RESTREND analysis was performed on both ES<inf>c</inf> and ES<inf>c+a</inf> to analyze the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to changes in NPP. The correlation analysis between NPP and climate variables suggested that precipitation was the dominant control of NPP in about 72% area, whereas temperature and solar radiation controlled NPP in Himalayan and forest-dominated regions, respectively. The human-influenced ecosystems (ES<inf>c+a</inf>) experienced an increasing trend in NPP, whereas natural ecosystems (ES<inf>c</inf>) experienced a decreasing trend, particularly in forest-dominated regions. Overall, NPP increased in the country during the study duration. The contributions of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities varied spatially and temporally. In general, climatic factors enhanced the NPP, whereas human activities contributed to a slight decline in NPP. These findings improve our understanding of how ecosystems in India are influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities in recent decades. The results from this study will aid in identifying ecological hotspots and key drivers for better ecosystem management strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic activities; Climate change; Net Primary Productivity (NPP); RESTREND","climate change; ecosystem management; India","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133208078"

The integrated approaches of Revised Annual Soil Loss, extensive field-based measurement, and applied techniques of Remote Sensing and GIS models were used to estimate the risk and hotspot of annual soil loss in the lateritic upland of the region. The five parameters were used in the RUSLE model as; Rainfall Erosivity(R), Soil erodibility (K), Slope Length and Steepness (LS), Land Cover and Crop Management(C), and Support Practice (P). The estimated annual average soil loss is recorded at > 7–20 ton/ha/year in the region.

This study aims to detect riverbank erosion and identify riverbank erosion hotspots along the Mekong River in Cambodia. A riverbank erosion rate map was developed using satellite images from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 (1990–2020) using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) at a resolution of 30 m and Sentinel-2 (2016–2021) using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) at a resolution of 10 m. Detecting riverbanks in satellite images using a water index depends greatly on image resolution and water threshold. The riverbank lines were validated using Google Earth images. In the data used in December 2017, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Sentinel-2 was 6.00 m, while the RMSE of Landsat was 6.04 m. In the data used in January 2019, the RMSE of Sentinel-2 was 4.12 m, while the RMSE of Landsat was 5.90 m. The hotspots were identified by overlaying the riverbank erosion rate map and the exposure map of population density and land cover. Field surveys and interviews were conducted to verify riverbank erosion hotspots in the Ruessei Srok and Kaoh Soutin communes. The results showed that within the last 30 years (1990–2020), the riverbank eroded more than 1 km in a direction perpendicular to the river in some segments of the Mekong River in Cambodia. The highest average annual erosion rate was in the Ruessei Srok Commune in Kampong Cham Province, at approximately 43 m/yr. Most eroded areas were farmland and rural residential areas. The riverbank hotspots are situated mainly in the lower part of the Mekong River, where the population is dense, and the erosion rate is high. Riverbank erosion hotspots with a very high impact level and ongoing active erosion include the Peam Kaoh Sna, Kampong Reab, Kaoh Soutin, and Ruessei Srok communes in Kampong Cham Province. This study provides an efficient tool for using satellite images to identify riverbank erosion hotpots in a large river basin. The riverbank erosion hotspot map is essential for decision-makers to prioritize interventions to reduce the risk of riverbank erosion and to improve the livelihood of the people residing along the Mekong River. © 2022 by the authors.

In recent decades, more attention has been paid to the issue of environmental safety in the world, and various methods have been developed to evaluate it, but to date, most research on ecological safety has been done based on the pressure-Status-response model and fewer studies have been conducted based on approach landscape ecology models have dealt with this category. There is also little research focusing on dynamic changes in ecological security, in particular simulating and predicting the future development of environmental security. The purpose of this study is to monitor and predict the environmental security situation in the period 1991 to 2035 by combining the support vector machine algorithm, landform ecology model, Markov chain combination model, and automated cells for the Nazarabad county area of the functions Alborz province. For this purpose, using the classification of Landsat satellite images in two 15-year time periods from 1991 to 2021, the trend of land use changes in the region in five land use classes; Construction lands, cultivated lands, wetlands, vegetation and barren lands were studied and CA-Markov model was used to prepare land use maps for 2035. MPS, CA, NP, PLAND, AWMSI, and PD metrics were calculated to quantify the landscape appearance patterns at the class level and LPI, CONTAG, and SHDI metrics were calculated at the landscape level. Then, the ecological safety index was modeled for the landscape metrics of the study area. The results indicate a decrease in integration and an increase in the number of spots in the cultivated land class and the development and expansion of man-made lands in these lands. On the other hand, we have witnessed the phenomenon of integration in the barren lands of the region. Therefore, the ecological security of the region during the study period affected by the above events was evaluated more intensively during the years 1991 to 2006 and more gently in the years 2006 to the forecast of 2035. It was suggested that more attention be paid to environmental considerations and principles of protection in regional development programs. © 2022, Shahid Beheshti University.

We have also seen the geographic expansion and outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases (EID) in recent years. This paper investigates the direct and indirect effects of land use land cover change (LULCC) on EID outbreaks in the context of Wayanad District of Kerala, India. Wayanad is in the vulnerable tropical forested region, and it is named as one of the four environmental change hotspots. The focus of this project is mainly three EIDs prevalent in this region: Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Dengue and Leptospirosis. Our results, based on topographical map, remote sensing and extensive field work, show that the natural forest in Wayanad was replaced with agriculture and forest plantation during 1950–2018. This paper further suggests that encroachment of forest by forest plantation causes the human–animal conflict resulting in the outbreak of KFD cases. Our analysis reveals that a high number of Dengue cases is found in the forested regions of the district and over the adjacent human-made agriculture plantation areas. High and medium number of Leptospirosis cases contain a high portion of land area devoted to paddy cultivation and agricultural plantation. In summary, the results clearly show the linkage between the outbreak of above mentioned EIDs and LULCC in the context of Wayanad district, Kerala. We also discuss in detail the causal pathway involving human–environmental dynamics through which plantation leads to the outbreak of KFD. Replacing forests with plantations poses an alarming threat of disease outbreak in the community. © 2022 by the authors.

The Lacandona region in southern Mexico holds one of the largest fragments of tropical rainforest in North America. We evaluated the deforestation of the Lacandona region harmonizing concepts and methodologies. An international (FAO definition), governmental (national definition), and regional definition of deforestation with applications at different scales were analyzed and harmonized with two classification methods (likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM)). We used 2015 and 2018 Landsat 8 images, and likelihood and SAM classifications were applied for FAO and regional definitions of deforestation. Overall, the best evaluated classifier in quantity was likelihood for 2015 and 2018 (kappa: 0.87 and 0.70, overall accuracy: 91.8 and 80.4%, and quantity disagreement: 4.1 and 10 %, respectively). The allocation disagreement only showed exchange between classes. Nevertheless, they did not show differences between classifiers, although 2015 had less disagreement than 2018: exchange, 4.1% for likelihood and SAM; shift: 0% for likelihood and SAM. Maps based on the regional definition of deforestation showed that the likelihood classification detected 11,441 ha less deforestation than SAM (40,538 and 51,979 ha, respectively). The FAO definition of deforestation showed that likelihood classification detected 11,914 ha less deforestation than SAM classification (37,152 and 49,066 ha, respectively). Further, the likelihood classification showed 3387 ha more of deforestation according to the regional definition than the FAO definition of deforestation (40,538 and 37,152 ha, respectively). SAM classification showed that the regional definition showed 2913 ha more deforestation than the FAO definition (51,979 and 49,066, respectively). We concluded that implementation of governmental programs in the Lacandona region requires estimations based on a careful selection of deforestation definitions and methods. © 2022 by the authors.

Three multi-class classification convolutional neural network (CNN) models were generated, showing F1-score values as high as 0.9 in only six epochs of training. Mangrove forests are tropical and subtropical environments that provide essential ecosystem services to local biota and coastal communities and are considered the most efficient vegetative carbon stock globally. Despite their importance, mangrove forest cover continues to decline worldwide, especially in SEA. Scientists have produced monitoring tools based on SRSI and CNNs to identify deforestation hotspots and drive targeted interventions. Nevertheless, although CNNs excel in distinguishing between different landcover types, their greatest limitation remains the need for significant computing power to operate. This may not always be feasible, especially in developing countries. The proposed framework is believed to provide a robust, low-cost, cloud-based, near-real-time monitoring tool that could serve governments, environmental agencies, and researchers, to help map mangroves in SEA. © 2022 by the authors.

The association between surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects and land use/land cover features has been studied extensively, but the situation in tropical cities is not well-understood due to the lack of consistent data. This study aimed to explore land use/land cover (LULC) changes and their impact on the urban thermal environment in a tropical megacity—Karachi, Pakistan. Land cover maps were produced, and the land surface temperature (LST) was estimated using Landsat images from five different years over the period 2000–2020. The surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) was then quantified based on the LST data. Statistical analyses, including geographically weighted regression (GWR) and correlation analyses, were performed in order to analyze the relationship between the land cover composition and LST. The results indicated that the built-up area of Karachi increased from 97.6 km2 to 325.33 km2 during the period 2000–2020. Among the different land cover types, the areas classified as built-up or bare land exhibited the highest LST, and a change from vegetation to bare land led to an increase in LST. The correlation analysis indicated that the correlation coefficients between the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and LST ranged from 0.14 to 0.18 between 2000 and 2020 and that NDBI plays a dominant role in influencing the LST. The GWR analysis revealed the spatial variation in the association between the land cover composition and the SUHII. Parks with large areas of medium-and high-density vegetation play a significant role in regulating the thermal environment, whereas the scattered vegetation patches in the urban core do not have a significant relationship with the LST. These findings can be used to inform adaptive land use planning that aims to mitigate the effects of the UHI and aid efforts to achieve sustainable urban growth. © 2022 by the authors.

Because greening implies land carbon storage, it can contribute to buffering climate changes. While tropical forests are responsible for an important amount of global greening, these environments have been increasingly fragmented, and fragments are thought to lose biomass over time. However, the interferences of forest fragmentation in greening and browning (decrease in vegetation biomass) balance have been an overlooked aspect of greening studies. Furthermore, the saturation of the vegetation indices often used for biomass assessment has been an important challenge for greening studies in dense tropical forests. Here we used Google Earth Engine to address greening and browning trends over the last 35 years for fragments of different sizes from a tropical hotspot, the Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil, and we contrasted the results obtained from two vegetation indices, the traditional NDVI, and the recently developed kNDVI. Despite the highly advanced fragmentation level, greening predominated over browning independently of fragment size (<10 ha, 10–100 ha, 100–1000 ha, and >1000 ha), occurring more frequently but with lower intensity in the larger patches. Although these tendencies did not change with the use of different vegetation indices, kNDVI proved to be more efficient to detect browning, to identify the different classes of intensity in both greening and browning, and for capturing the extreme greening and browning levels, confirming its lower saturation in relation to NDVI. Climate and anthropogenic effects on vegetation were found only for small and isolated patches of pixels. Our results contradicted the prediction of a continuous unidirectional trend of biomass loss in highly fragmented habitats and revealed that although tropical forest fragments may retain less biomass than continuous forest tracts they may act as carbon sinks, and this can be another important reason for their conservation. © 2022","Biomass storage; Carbon storage; Forest fragmentation; Global warming; Remote sensing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128266187"

In this context, we used a mixed methodology (two quantitative methods). Landsat imagery, including a patchy Landsat ETM+ for the year 2000 and a Landsat 8 for the year 2020, was used to map and assess land use to investigate sprawl and land-use change, and ArcGIS was used to investigate the potential for infill development in this city. The results show that between 2000 and 2020, 967 hectares of peri-urban land was lost to urban expansion. CA-Markov projections also showed that 452 hectares will be lost by 2030. The assessment of the city’s internal capacity for infill development showed that more than 999 hectares of land within the city are suitable to support this strategy and provide the land needed for urban expansion over the next decade. Finally, the study of the city’s master plan, which applies to all Iranian cities, discovered that there is a lack of adequate outlook regarding the amount of land available for future urban development, leading to misuse of urban land and urban sprawl in Iranian cities, suggesting that an infill development strategy could be a good way to address this issue. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to gradual increase in the urban population and impervious surfaces, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has increased manifold in the cities of developing countries, causing a decline in thermal comfort. Therefore, this study was designed to model the spatio-temporal pattern of UHI and its relationships with the land use indices of Delhi and Mumbai metro cities from 1991 to 2018. Landsat datasets were used to generate the land surface temperature (LST) using mono window algorithm and land use indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference bareness index (NDBal), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). Additionally, the urban hotspots (UHS) were identified and then the thermal comfort was modelled using the UTFVI. The results showed that maximum (30.25–38.99 °C in Delhi and 42.10–45.75 °C in Mumbai) and minimum (17.70–23.86 °C in Delhi and 19.06–25.05 °C in Mumbai) LST witnessed steady growth in Delhi and Mumbai from 1991 to 2018. The LST gap decreases and the UHI zones are being established in both cities. Furthermore, the UHS and worst-category UTFVI areas increased in both cities.

Addressing the challenges, most especially in developing countries with high birth rate, high net migration and unregulated land use policies require an understanding of the urban sprawl status of not only cities but also smaller admininstrative units (LGA, counties etc.) components of cities. Satellite imageries and geographic information systems (GIS), coupled with existing rule-based algorithms offer a unique and a rapid way of assessing urban sprawl dynamics. This study not only identified the spatiotemporal pattern of land use/landcover change but also morphologically characterised urban sprawl at metropolitan and LGA units in the Ibadan metropolis using Landsat imagery of 1984, 2000, 2008 and 2013.The LAC, LAR, SDI, SEI and LPI indicators of urban sprawl were computed for the urban built-up patch for each year. The annual rate of urban expansion was 1284.73 ha, while the population grew at 55,513 per annum between 1984 and 2013. Hence, the city grew rapidly between 1984 and 2000, however, the rate of growth has slowed down drastically since 2000. Also, leapfrog and edge developments type of sprawl were decreasing, while infilling was increasing, although at a slower rate in the metropolis. Increases in salaries, increasing transportation cost, dispersed activity space and desire to live closer to workplaces are some of the factors responsible for the increasing compact city development. Urban compactness rather than sprawl will most likely continue beyond 2013 based on the results of the Markov Chain analysis. Remotely sensed imageries are suitable for the assessment of not only urban growth but also morphological pattern of urban sprawl at metropolitan and LGA units. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Edge development; Infilling development; Land use/land cover; Leapfrog development; Urban sprawl","developing world; land cover; land use planning; metropolitan area; modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; urban sprawl; Ibadan; Nigeria; Oyo","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099382492"

In addition, urbanization is spreading at an alarming rate across the globe, affecting the environment and society in profound ways. This study reviews previous studies that examined future scenarios of urban areas under the challenges of rapid population growth, urban sprawl and water scarcity in order to improve supported decision-making (SDM). Scholars expected that the rapid development of the urbanization scenario would cause resource sustainability to continually be threatened as a result of excessive use of natural resources. In contrast, a sustainable development scenario is an ambitious plan that relies on optimal land use, which views land as a limited and non-renewable resource. In consequence, estimating these threats together could be crucial for planning sustainable strategies for the long term. In light of this review, the SDM tool could be improved by combining the cellular automata model, water evolution and planning model coupled with geographic information systems, remote sensing and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Urban planners could use the proposed tool to optimize, simulate and visualize the dynamic processes of land-use change and urban water to overcome critical conditions. © 2022","Scenario; Simulation; Sustainable; Urbanization; Water security","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129358672"

Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i.e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots - California, USA and Rondônia, Brazil – for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's accuracies) 0.74–0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59–0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38–0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondônia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Clear-cuts; Computer vision; Smart forest management; Transfer learning; Tropical deforestation","Computer vision; Deep learning; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; California; Clear cuts; Cloud cover; Forest harvesting; Landscape pattern; Salvage logging; Sentinel-1; Smart forest management; Transfer learning; Tropical deforestation; Mapping; cloud cover; deforestation; dry season; environmental disturbance; machine learning; mapping method; radar imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; timber harvesting; time series analysis; Brazil; Rondonia; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120712847"

In this context, understanding future trends of LUCs, such as deforestation, in a spatial manner is relevant. The main objective of this study is to generate a deforestation prediction model for a given period of time (i.e., 2002–2017 and 2010–2017) to estimate the potential carbon emissions associated with different anthropogenic variables in the Peruvian Amazon using machine learning (ML) algorithms. This study was motivated in the analysis of a road project previously studied using life cycle assessment (LCA). Models using neural networks and random forest algorithms were trained and evaluated in a fully cloud-based environment using Google Earth Engine. ML-related results demonstrated that random forest is a quicker and straightforward response to model the system under study, especially considering that data do not require additional processing during the modeling and prediction stages. Predicted results suggest that expected road expansion may be related to considerable carbon emissions in the future. Calculated values are relevant especially if the mitigation efforts that Peru has complied with in the Paris Agreement are considered. The increased complexity of the framework is justified since it allows identifying the location of hotspots and may potentially complement the utility of LCA in policy support in the areas of territorial planning and tropical road expansion. © 2021 by Yale University","Amazon rainforest; climate change; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment; Peru; random forest","Carbon; Decision making; Decision trees; Deforestation; Expansion; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Highway planning; Land use; Life cycle; Predictive analytics; Random forests; Roads and streets; Anthropogenic activity; Calculated values; Construction projects; Machine learning techniques; Modeling and predictions; Prediction model; Random forest algorithm; Territorial planning; Machine learning; complexity; decision making; deforestation; exploration; life cycle analysis; machine learning; project assessment; territorial planning; Amazon River; Amazonia; Peru","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113288827"

Despite significant attention in environmental management research, the means to tackle wetland changes are still gaining momentum in science and research within developing countries. With the increasing availability of remote sensing data and flexible solutions, finding the right solution to wetland changes becomes a key research and policy agenda. Herein, we assessed the wetland change prediction of Ogun River (OR) basin, Nigeria, during 1999, 2009, and 2019 by analyzing land cover change (LCC) images using cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) chain and remote sensing (RS) techniques. The acquired shuttle radar topographic mapper and Landsat remotely sensed data were applied to create thematic-maps of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference salinity index (NDSI), and digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area. The CA-Markov required the supervised classification of the land cover maps of 1999, 2009, and 2019. The results of the elevation, NDVI, and NDSI revealed the qualitative differences in the study area. The LCC analysis indicated that farmlands and built-up areas increased by 54.56 and 33.21 %, respectively. However, waterbodies, wetlands, and vegetation decreased by 0.42, 3.53, and 8.28 % respectively. These findings agree with the CA-Markov with an accuracy exceeding 70 %, and, thus predict the wetland changes for the year 2030. The major attributions to wetland cover variations in the study area are built-up encroachment with extensive, spontaneous, and uncontrolled agricultural activities. This study, through its findings, provides relevant guidelines and information on wetland changes required by stakeholders for environmental policy, planning, and sustainability. © 2022 The Authors","Cellular automata-Markov; Ecosystem problem; Nigeria's Ogun River basin; Remote sensing indices; Wetland change","cellular automaton; digital elevation model; environmental management; land cover; Landsat; NDVI; remote sensing; supervised classification; wetland management; Nigeria; Ogun Basin","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154553495"

This study includes the forest cover change in the western ghats of India from 2014 to 2022. Sahyadri ranges or western ghats are one of the most verdant and densely forested mountain ranges in India; hence, even a little shift in flora can aid in deciphering and predicting numerous topographical changes. We have utilized the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for determining vegetation in a particular patch of land. The forest land cover classification has been done on into three categories like low, moderate, high vegetation as well as bare areas, and tropical forests.

This study demonstrates how to mitigate uncertainties in modeling land change in the Ci Kapundung upper water catchment area by comparing the outcomes of two simulation phases. A conventional cellular automata (CA)–Markov model was complemented with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to project future land cover maps in the study area. The CA–Markov–MLP model results in high uncertainties in forested sites where a data gap is apparent in the input data (land cover maps and driver variables) and parameters. The results show that the model accuracy is improved from 47.90% in the first phase to 81.36% in the second phase. Both first and second phases integrate six demographic–economic and environmental drivers in the modeling, but the second phase also incorporates an updating and backdating analysis to revise the base-maps. This study suggests that uncertainties can be mitigated by linking such base-map revision process with the updating and backdating analyses using remote sensing datasets retrieved at different times. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CA–Markov; cellular automata; Land cover change; multilayer perceptron; uncertainty","cellular automaton; developing world; land cover; land use change; Markov chain; modeling; uncertainty analysis; Greater Sunda Islands; Java; Sunda Isles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135166553"

This practice is controversial due to its potential for serious economic, food security, and environmental impacts—especially for intensive operations in and near mangrove ecosystems, where many shrimp species spawn. While considerable effort has been directed toward understanding aquaculture impacts, maps of spatial extent and multi-decade spatiotemporal dynamics remain sparse. This is in part because aquaculture ponds (ghers) can be challenging to distinguish from other shallow water targets on the basis of water-leaving radiance alone. Here, we focus on the Lower Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta (GBD), one of the most expansive areas of recent aquaculture growth on Earth and adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest, a biodiversity hotspot. We use a combination of MODIS 16-day EVI composites and 45 years (1972–2017) of Landsat observations to characterize dominant spatiotemporal patterns in the vegetation phenology of the area, identify consistent seasonal optical differences between flooded ghers and other land uses, and quantify the multi-decade expansion of standing water bodies. Considerable non-uniqueness exists in the spectral signature of ghers on the GBD, propagating into uncertainty in estimates of spatial extent. We implement three progressive decision boundaries to explicitly quantify this uncertainty and provide liberal, moderate, and conservative estimates of flooded gher extent on three different spatial scales. Using multiple extents and multiple thresholds, we quantify the size distribution of contiguous regions of flooded gher extent at ten-year intervals. The moderate threshold shows standing water area within Bangladeshi polders to have expanded from less than 300 km2 in 1990 to over 1400 km2 in 2015. At all three scales investigated, the size distribution of standing water bodies is increasingly dominated by larger, more interconnected networks of flooded areas associated with aquaculture. Much of this expansion has occurred in immediate proximity to the Bangladeshi Sundarbans. © 2021 by the authors.

The average temperature on Earth is roughly 15 °C, but it has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural climatic changes, but experts say temperatures are already rising faster than at any other period in history. Unplanned urbanization can sometimes backfire, causing negative consequences that harm the economy and contribute to environmental damages, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. Because of the strong association between land use/land cover and land surface temperature (LST), the study attempted to analyze and estimate LULC and seasonal (both summer and winter) LSTs using Landsat satellite images at 5-year intervals from 1995 to 2020. Later, the study forecasted both LULC and seasonal LSTs for 2030 and 2040 using cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms for Rajshahi district. As supporting parameters for determining the magnitude of climate change effects owing to urbanization and temperature rise, primary data collection procedures such as focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) with experts from diverse sectors were used. Results reveal that the built-up area was increased from 158.22 km2 (6.64%) to 386.74 km2 (16.23%) in this 25 years’ timeframe, and it contributed the highest average temperature (41.68 °C in 2020 in summer) comparing with other LULCs. The LSTs were increasing at an alarming rate with 1–2 °C standard deviations per 5 years and maximum temperature was increased from 1995 to 2020 by 37.22 to 42.7 °C) in summer and 22.18 to 28.94 °C in winter. Prediction states that net increase of built-up area will be 2.51 and 5.29, respectively, in 2030 and 2050 from 2020. Maximum LST will likely to be increased to 43.23 °C (2030) and 45.92 °C (2040) in summer, and 30.94 °C (2030) and 31.77 °C (2040) in winter. FGDs and KIIs assessments indicate that frequent LULC change was the main reason for increasing LSTs (71%) and 76% experts agreed that heat waves are the most influencing factors for adverse climate change, among other parameters. The work introduces new methods for integrating remote sensing data with primary datasets, which will provide substantial insights to urban planners and policymakers in terms of participatory and sustainable planning. © 2021, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).","Artificial neural network; Cellular automata; Land surface temperature; Participatory planning; Urbanization","algorithm; artificial neural network; carbon emission; cellular automaton; climate change; data set; human activity; land cover; land use; Landsat; machine learning; remote sensing; surface temperature; urbanization; Bangladesh; Rajshahi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119328959"

The port based industrial development plays a pivotal role for growth of urban expansion and transport development over once the agricultural dominant area in Haldia Municipality, West Bengal. This study emphasised on the relationship between urban expansion and transport development using various geospatial and statistical techniques. Land use/cover maps have been prepared in ArcGIS v.10.1 for 2001 and 2018 with the help of Landsat images then road network connectivity was analysed using statistical techniques and GIS environment. Kernel density was used for analysing hybrid road network density. Finally, correlation technique was applied to find out the spatial relationship between the exiting transportation and population. Based on the results, we found the value of coefficient of determination as 0.651 that means transportation development is rigidly controlled by population density. So, urban area was expanded day after day through the huge population pressure over the study area. Moreover, hybrid road transport networks were developed which are well connected to all the fringe areas from the city centre for providing better transport accessibility and facility. But, the planning of urban area through transportation is required to give more attention on proper allocation of others urban services especially for the city people. © 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences","Connectivity hotspot map; Haldia Municipality; Hybrid road network density; Kernel density; Transportation development","Agricultural robots; Developing countries; Expansion; Land use; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Urban growth; Coefficient of determination; Correlation techniques; Industrial development; Population densities; Road transport networks; Spatial relationships; Statistical techniques; Transportation development; Urban transportation; ArcGIS; land cover; land use; Landsat; mapping; network analysis; road transport; transportation development; urban development; urban transport; India; West Bengal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095983309"

It threatens the conservation of its biodiversity as well as the capability to provide ecosystem services. Land-use policies, such as zonation programs, have been traditionally used as a tool for promoting a sustainable natural resource management; however, we still lack standardized methodologies that can be applied world-widely to achieve this purpose. In the current context of rampant deforestation over the tropical forests, there is an urgent need of identifying policies that steer agricultural land-use change into a reduced pressure on forests. This study focuses on the outcomes of the first territorial planning law in the Province of Formosa (Argentina) located within the Chaco region, one of the world's deforestation hotspots. The research questions were: a) How did agriculture expand in Formosa before, during and after the enactment of the territorial planning law? b) Did the introduction of the law affect the spatial distribution of land-use change?; and c) How did the sanction of the law affect forest loss and forest fragmentation? Landsat imagery was used to map land-use change, and to calculate the cover loss and cover loss rate considering the zoning and physiognomic classification of the law. The forest fragmentation was evaluated in terms of forest loss spatial configuration, classified as perforation or shrinkage, forest edge generation, patch size distribution, and patch isolation. The territorial planning law effect over agricultural expansion was tested using a difference in difference model. After the law was passed, a reduced land-use pressure was observed for the forest within the conservation designated zone; however, the forest presented the highest cover loss rates among the physiognomic categories of the law. Land-use change within the conservation designated zone was predominantly made according to a perforation spatial configuration, which promoted the forest edge generation. The isolation between forest patches decreased and its size distribution changed towards a less large-patch-centered pattern, indicating that Formosa is experiencing an early fragmentation process. Overall, the territorial planning law in Formosa succeeded in the relief of land-use pressure on forest, but highlighted the need of incorporating spatial configuration guidelines for long-term forest conservation. The case of Formosa case could be useful in the design of future sustainable natural resource management policies and implies the importance of early natural resource planning. © 2021","agricultural expansion; Chaco region; deforestation; difference in difference; forest fragmentation; landscape planning; remote sensing; zoning policy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116881562"

High rates of deforestation, however, place it as the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Brazil. Due to its heterogeneity, biomass and carbon stocks in the Cerrado vegetation are highly variable, and mapping and monitoring these stocks are not a trivial effort. To address this challenge, we built an aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) model for the Cerrado biome using 30-m resolution optical satellite imagery (Landsat-5 and Landsat-8), 25-m resolution SAR imagery (ALOS and ALOS-2), and a set of plot-based and LiDAR-derived AGWB estimates (n = 1858) from a wide network of researchers in Brazil. We implemented both a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to model AGWB over the native vegetation in the year 2019 (as classified by MapBiomas) in the Cerrado. The RF algorithms resulted in a slightly better result (R2 = 53%; rel. RMSE = 57%) than the CART model (R2 = 45%; rel. RMSE = 63%), but our map shows an underestimation of very high AGWB (negative bias over 200 t ha−1) and a slight overestimation of low AGWB (positive bias), especially in the RF model (bias of 1.19 t ha−1 against 0.86 t ha−1 for the CART model). We believe we have contributed to knowledge on the woody biomass stocks in the biome, especially in the predominant savanna woodlands, which is where the highest current rates of conversion take place in the Cerrado. © 2021","ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Landsat; LiDAR; Machine learning; Savanna; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Biodiversity; Carbon; Decision trees; Deforestation; Learning systems; Mapping; Optical radar; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Above-ground woody biomass; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Brazilian cerrado; Cerrado biomes; LANDSAT; LiDAR; Machine-learning; Savanna; Biomass; aboveground biomass; algorithm; ALOS; biodiversity; biomass; cerrado; Landsat; lidar; mapping method; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; vegetation cover; woodland; woody plant; Plants; Brazil; Matthiola","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113151035"

However, several other factors may play important roles. From a conservation perspective, it is important to assess the impacts of these changes in biodiversity hotspots, but adequate data are scarce. We repeated point-count bird monitoring at 29 count-points in an Afromontane ecosystem near Big Babanki in NW Cameroon after a 13-year period. Between the censuses in 2003 and 2016, we found a decrease in bush cover and an increase in herb layer, whereas tree cover did not change. Consequently, we found a decrease in the total number of bird individuals per count-point driven by a decrease in the abundances of shrubland species, mainly nectarivores and granivores (e.g., Northern double-collared sunbird, Black crowned waxbill, Oriole finch, Thick-billed seedeater or Baglafecht weaver). In general, the decrease was found in nectarivore species that depend on flowering bushes (mainly Hypericum spp.). Similarly, we found a decrease in approximately half of the granivore species that often use bush cover for nesting and feeding. Additionally, one large fruit feeding bird, the Great blue turaco, became nearly extinct probably due to hunting activity. The observed contraction of bush cover accompanied by shrubland bird declines possibly results from a decrease in humidity in the area that was indicated by remote sensing. This may be caused by montane forest loss and fragmentation during the second half of the 20th Century. Our findings uncover the long-term consequences of deforestation which are rarely considered, even though they impact key ecosystem functions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bird community; Granivores; Long-term changes; Nectarivores; Shrubland birds","abundance; Afrotropical Region; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; bird; feeding behavior; forest ecosystem; hunting; remote sensing; tropical environment; tropical region; Corythaeola cristata; Estrilda nonnula; Hypericum; Nectarinia preussi; Ploceus baglafecht; Serinus burtoni","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110359977"

In this study, we quantified the loss of these services through remote sensing, modeling and a statistical approach within water catchment perimeters. The main result is a synthetic geographical database of the water catchment perimeters indicating for each the loss of functions as regards the forest's ecosystem services. In the main island, we found that 54% of the water catchment perimeters were highly degraded, 38% were degraded and only 8% slightly degraded.

In the context of New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot, the availability of up-to-date LULC maps is essential to monitor the impact of extreme events such as cyclones and human activities on the environment. With the democratization of satellite data and the development of high-performance deep learning techniques, it is possible to create these data automatically. This work aims at determining the best current deep learning configuration (pixel-wise vs. semantic labelling architectures, data augmentation, image prepos-sessing, … ), to perform LULC mapping in a complex, subtropical environment. For this purpose, a specific data set based on SPOT6 satellite data was created and made available for the scientific community as an LULC benchmark in a tropical, complex environment using five representative areas of New Caledonia labelled by a human operator: four used as training sets, and the fifth as a test set. Several architectures were trained and the resulting classification was compared with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique: XGboost. We also assessed the relevance of popular neo-channels derived from the raw observations in the context of deep learning. The deep learning approach showed comparable results to XGboost for LC detection and over-performed it on the LU detection task (61.45% vs. 51.56% of overall accuracy). Finally, adding LC classification output of the dedicated deep learning architecture to the raw channels input significantly improved the overall accuracy of the deep learning LU classification task (63.61% of overall accuracy). All the data used in this study are available on line for the remote sensing community and for assessing other LULC detection techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

This is particularly so for the world's tropical dry forests, where remote sensing of forest disturbances is challenging due to high canopy complexity, strong phenology and climate variability, and diverse degradation drivers. Here, we used the full depth of the Landsat archive and devised an approach to detect disturbances related to forest degradation across the entire Argentine Dry Chaco (about 489,000 km2) over a 30-year timespan. We used annual time series of different spectral indices, summarized for three seasonal windows, and applied LandTrendr to temporally segment each time series. The resulting pixel-level forest disturbance metrics then served as input for a Random Forests classification which we used to produce an area-wide disturbance map, and associated yearly area estimates of disturbed forest. Finally, we evaluated disturbance trends in relation to climate and soil conditions. Our best model produced a disturbance map with an overall accuracy of 79%, with a balanced error distribution. A total of 8% (24,877 ± 860 km2) of the remaining forest in the Argentine Dry Chaco have been affected by forest disturbances between 1990 and 2017. Diverse spatial patterns of forest disturbances indicate a variety of agents driving disturbances. We also found the disturbed area to vary strongly between years, with larger areas being disturbed during drought years. Our approach shows that it is possible to robustly map forest disturbances in tropical dry forests using Landsat time series, and demonstrates the value of ensemble approaches to capture spectrally-complex and heterogeneous land-change processes. For the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, our analyses provide the first Landsat-based assessment of forest disturbance in remaining forests, highlighting the need to better consider such disturbances in assessments of carbon budgets and biodiversity change. © 2021","Ensemble classification; Forest degradation; LandTrendr; Random Forests; Trajectory analyses; Tropical dry forests","algorithm; dry forest; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; image classification; Landsat; time series; trajectory; tropical forest; Argentina; Chaco [Argentina]; Argentinidae","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113437355"

Thus, predicting future urban growth in the most rapidly growing region of Nigeria becomes a significant endeavor. This study analyzes land use and land cover (LULC) change and predicts the future urban growth of the Lagos metropolitan region, using Cellular Automata (CA) model. To achieve this, the GlobeLand30 datasets from years 2000 and 2010 were used to obtain LULC maps, which were utilized for modeling and prediction. Change analysis and prediction for LULC scenario for 2030 were performed using LCM and CA Markov chain modeling. The results show a substantial growth of artificial surfaces, which will cause further reductions in cultivated land, grassland, shrubland, wetland, and waterbodies. There was no appreciable impact of change for bare land, as its initial extent of cover later disappeared completely. Additionally, artificial surfaces/urban growth in Lagos expanded to the neighboring towns and localities in Ogun State during the study period, and it is expected that such growth will be higher in 2030. Lastly, the study findings will be beneficial to urban planners and land use managers in making key decisions regarding urban growth and improved land use management in Nigeria. © 2021 by the authors.","cellular automata; GlobeLand30; growth prediction; Lagos; LULC change; Markov chain; remote sensing; urban sprawl","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110337619"

Although prior literature has linked deforestation to global supply chains, here we provide a fine-scale representation of spatial patterns of deforestation associated with international trade. Using remote sensing data and a multi-region input–output model, we quantify and map the spatiotemporal changes in global deforestation footprints over 15 years (2001–2015) at a 30-m resolution. We find that, while many developed countries, China and India have obtained net forest gains domestically, they have also increased the deforestation embodied in their imports, of which tropical forests are the most threatened biome. Consumption patterns of G7 countries drive an average loss of 3.9 trees per person per year. Some of the hotspots of deforestation embodied in international trade are also biodiversity hotspots, such as in Southeast Asia, Madagascar, Liberia, Central America and the Amazonian rainforest. Our results emphasize the need to reform zero-deforestation policies through strong transnational efforts and by improving supply chain transparency, public–private engagement and financial support for the tropics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Central America; China; commercial phenomena; environmental protection; forest; human; India; international cooperation; Madagascar; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Humans; Internationality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103387600"

Biodiversity hotspots are characterised by a high number of endemic species cooccurring with a high level of anthropogenic pressure. In central Chile, the pressure is caused by land-use change, in which near-natural primary and secondary forests are replaced and fragmented by commercial pine and eucalyptus plantations. Large forest fires are another factor that can potentially endanger biodiversity. Usually, environmental hazards, such as wildfires, are part of the regular environmental dynamic and not considered a threat to biodiversity. Nonetheless, this situation may change if land-use change and altered wildfire regimes coerce. Land-use change pressure may destroy landscape integrity in terms of habitat loss and fragmentation, while wildfires may destroy the last remnants of native forests. This study aims to understand the joint effects of land-use change and a catastrophic wildfire on habitat loss and habitat fragmentation of local plant species richness hotspots in central Chile. To achieve this, we apply a combination of ecological fieldwork, remote sensing, and geoprocessing to estimate the spread and spatial patterns of biodiverse habitats under current and past land-use conditions and how these habitats were altered by land-use change and by a single large wildfire event. We show that land-use change has exceeded the wildfire’s impacts on diverse habitats. Despite the fact that the impact of the wildfire was comparably small here, wildfire may coerce with land-use change regarding pressure on biodiversity hotspots. Our findings can be used to develop restoration concepts, targeting on an increase of habitat diversity within currently fire-cleared areas and evaluate their benefits for plant species richness conservation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biodiversity hotspot; Central Chile; Landscape metrics; Plantation forestry; Wildfire","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103346581"

Proper knowledge of these changes would provide crucial information for planning conservation strategies. We evaluated the impact of the intensification of agricultural and urban land-use on the Inter-Andean Dry Forest and Tropical Montane Forest, both of which are categorized as Critically Endangered, and the state of the landscape in the High Rio Guayllabamba watershed, Ecuador, during the periods 1991-2005 and 2005-2017. The evaluation was carried out using Landsat satellite images of 30 x 30 m pixels and landscape metrics. We found an advanced state of landscape transformation. Since the 1990s, the loss of both ecosystems was largely caused by the conversion of forest to agriculture, resulting in substantial changes in the spatial configuration of these ecosystems. From 1991 to 2017, 19.8 % and 16.1 % of Inter-Andean Dry Forest and Tropical Montane Forest respectively, were converted to agriculture. The loss of Inter-Andean Dry Forest was 28 % and the number of forest patches increased by more than 150%. The loss of Tropical Montane Forest was 16.5 % and the number of forest patches increased by more than 300 %. The largest loss and fragmentation of forest cover occurred from 1991 to 2005. We suggested planning landscape-scale conservation, using the patch-corridor-matrix model. This model is appropriate given the current configuration of the landscape studied, with Inter-Andean Dry Forest and Tropical Montane Forest restricted to small patches sparsely distributed across the landscape. © 2021 Sciendo.

As the leading area of China’s reform and opening-up, Guangdong province in southern China is subjected to land-use conversion that significantly alters the capacity of natural ecosystem to provide ecosystem services supporting human well-being. We analyzed the characteristics of land-use changes from 1990 to 2018 using the four-phase land-use data interpreted from Landsat satellite images. We estimated the ecosystem service value through a well-established benefit transfer method using modified local value coefficients, analyzed the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services through ecosystem service trade-off degree, and compared the relationship between ecosystem services value, economic development, and population in Guangdong province. The results indicated that the following: (1) Built-Up Area drastically expanded from 6783.1 km2 in 1990 to 13,142.0 km2 in 2018 (93.7%), especially in the Pearl River Delta, where the growth rate of Built-Up Area expansion was up to 169.0%. The other land-use types were all contracted as Cropland (−10.9%), Forestland (−1.0%), Grassland (−4.0%), Water Body (−2.1%), and Unused Land (−24.4%). (2) Total ecosystem service value decreased from US$121,666 billion in 1990 to US$116,432 billion in 2018 (−4.3%). Cropland, Forestland, and Water Body played the most important roles for the total ecosystem service value. Water supply experienced the largest declines in ecosystem services value (US$ −1866.3 million, −10.1%), followed by waste treatment (7.6%) and gas regulation (−4.9%). (3) Synergy was the dominant relationship among ecosystem services.

Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images are processed to monitor the flood disaster in Pungue and Buzi rivers by combining the object-based image analysis approach and the decision tree algorithm. Water is preliminarily extracted from Sentinel-1 image, and shadows of mountain and buildings in the study area are extracted from Sentinel-2 image. Mountain shadow is extracted based on the decision tree classification rules constructed by the digital elevation model and the index model, while building shadow is extracted by constructing the decision tree classification rules using the features of objects. Water extraction results are combined with shadows to eliminate confusing shadows in the preliminary extraction to obtain the accurate flood extent. Sentinel-2 images are used to classify land use types in multiple periods before and after the flood and analyze the disaster by combining with the change information of the water. Land use type changes are analyzed and predicted with the CA-Markov model. The results show that the maximum submerged area was 3.5 times of the normal water area, and that most areas were submerged for more than 10 d. The area between Pungue and Buzi rivers were severely affected, where a large number of crops and villages were submerged. Grassland and cropland were the most seriously submerged. The overall accuracy of extracted water results ranges from 86% to 92%.

It is necessary to develop appropriate monitoring techniques for tracking transport space evolution. The work explores the impacts of urban growth dynamics of transport space over the past decades as a basis for predicting future space demands in Kano, Nigeria. Three epochs of Landsat images from 1984, 2013 and 2019 were processed, classified and analyzed. Spatial classifications of land-use/land-cover (LULC) types in Kano include transport space, built-up areas, vegetation, farmland, bare land and water. The data analysis involves model calibration, validation and prediction using areas using the hybrid modeling techniques-cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) in IDIRISI SELVA 17.0 and remote-sensing ARC-GIS 10.7 softwares. The result finds significant expansion of transport and built-up areas while other LULC receded throughout the entire study period. Predictive modeling of transport infrastructure shows spatial expansion by 345 km2 (3.9%) and 410 km2 (11.7%) in 2030 and 2050 respectively. Kappa reliability indices of agreement (KIA) classified images and ground maps were 85%, 86% and 88%, respectively, for 1984, 2013 and 2019 time series. The calibration quality met the 80% minimum suggested in literature for the spatial-temporal track and prediction of urban growth phenomena. © 2020 by the authors.

A spatial vulnerability assessment is required to formulate disaster risk reduction strategies. This study develops a comprehensive tropical cyclone vulnerability mapping approach by applying Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and geospatial techniques and examines the spatial distribution of tropical cyclone vulnerability in the western coastal region of Bangladesh. We have selected 18 spatial criteria under the physical, social, and mitigation capacity categories as the components of vulnerability. Results indicate that the southern and south-eastern peripheral areas exhibit higher vulnerability to tropical cyclones since these areas comprise low elevation, gentle slope, closeness to the sea, a high number of historical cyclone tracks, vulnerable land cover classes (settlements and crops land), and poor socio-economic structures. These areas cover most of the Barguna, Khulna, Bagerhat, Jhalokati, and southern parts of Satkhira, and Pirojpur districts. The existing mitigation capacity measures, for example, the construction of cyclone shelters, embankments, road networks, and effective warning systems in these areas are not adequate levels.

However, population growth, increas-ing demand for agricultural products and land use changes are affecting their sustainability. This thesis aimed to develop a multi-dimen-sional approach to assess forest degradation and how it is related to land use dynamics, in order to estimate forest vulnerability. The studies for this thesis were conducted in Paragomi-nas (Brazil) and Di Linh (Vietnam). In Parago-minas, forest degradation is directly linked to selective logging and forest fires, which alter the structure of forests. We used remote sensing tools and data on carbon stocks to map aerial forest biomass, and investigated the consequences of degradation on forest struc-ture. We observed that 58% of forest degradation was accounted for by changes in land use. The distribution of degraded forests is driven by their fragmentation due to the expansion of soya cultivation, but is also associated with recent deforestation and slash-and-burn prac-tices. In Di Linh, forest degradation is due to encroachment by coffee plantations. By com-bining an inventory of different types of land use with Sentinel-2 images, we were able to map current land cover. We then built up the trajectories of landscape dynamics to charac-terise the expansion of the agricultural frontier. We identified the degradation and fragmentation trajectories that produce effects of greater or lesser intensity on the forest cover. Taken together, these indicators bring out vulnerability hotspots. Thanks to the remote sensing approaches and indicators developed for forests on the landscape scale, we were able to provide a holistic diagnosis of forests within landscapes altered by humans. This thesis aims to open up avenues for appropriate and priority management of degraded forests on the scale of the landscape.

Over the last few decades, there has been warming, with an escalation of drought and rapid population growth. This will further intensify the risk of desertification, which will seriously affect the local ecological environment, food security and people’s lives. The goal of this research is to analyze the hydrological and land cover characteristics and variability over global arid and semi-arid regions over the last decade (2010–2019) using an integrative approach of remotely sensed and physical process-based numerical modeling (e.g., Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) models) data. Interaction between hydrological and ecological indicators including precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface soil moisture and vegetation indices are presented in the global four types of arid and semi-arid areas. The trends followed by precipitation, evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture over the decade are also mapped using harmonic analysis. This study also shows that some hotspots in these global drylands, which exhibit different processes of land cover change, demonstrate strong coherency with noted groundwater variations. Various types of statistical measures are computed using the satellite and model derived values over global arid and semi-arid regions. Comparisons between satellite-(NASA-USDA Surface Soil Moisture and MODIS Evapotranspiration data) and model (FLDAS and GLDAS)-derived values over arid regions (BSh, BSk, BWh and BWk) have shown the over and underestimation with low accuracy. Moreover, general consistency is apparent in most of the regions between GLDAS and FLDAS model, while a strong discrepancy is also observed in some regions, especially appearing in the Nile Basin downstream hyper-arid region. Data-driven modelling approaches are thus used to enhance the models’ performance in this region, which shows improved results in multiple statistical measures ((RMSE), bias (ψ), the mean absolute percentage difference (|ψ|)) and the linear regression coefficients (i.e., slope, intercept, and coefficient of determination (R2)). © 2020 by the authors.

The study methods employed mainly included land use transition matrix, kernel density estimation, grid and buffer analysis of the ArcGIS software and remote sensing image processing. The changes of land use mainly reflected in the transformation between different land types, among which the conversion from forestland into arable land constituted the major event. Though the land use change rate was not so significant for the whole region, dramatic changes occurred around the towns especially in the northern area. It was found that a circle of arable land of about 6 km in width and more than 40% arable land density composed the farming hinterland of the major towns. Moreover, with the forest transition theory the change trends of land use and their influencing factors were analysed. The findings in this study should be helpful for the land use simulation and planning in similar riparian areas.

As a consequence, declining water tables are exposing peat to oxidation, converting plant material accumulated over millennia to carbon dioxide, and causing land subsidence. Here, we quantify the widespread peat carbon loss by using InSAR remote sensing to map subsidence at 90-m resolution across 2.7 Mha of peatland area from 2007 to 2011. Over 90% of the surveyed area is subsiding, with a mean rate of 2.2 cm yr−1. Consequently, the region now faces loss of productive land and flooding because many peatlands are near sea level. Our measurements reveal that smallholder agricultural areas and degraded peatlands are subsiding at rates comparable to those of plantations, and that subsidence rates increase away from rivers and decrease over time following drainage. Because of its detailed spatial resolution, InSAR provides a valuable tool to identify emissions by land use and geography and to target hotspots for better management. Finally, we use remotely sensed maps to update IPCC emissions factors and calculate regional CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from peat oxidation of 155 ± 30 MtC yr−1 in 2015, similar in magnitude to both regional fossil-fuel emissions and peat fires. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","carbon emission; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; peatland; remote sensing; spatial resolution; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; water table; Southeast Asia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086034464"

This limits the decision-making processes and the effectiveness of forest management policies. In this paper, we address the extent and drivers of deforestation of the Choco biodiversity hotspot, which has not received much scientific attention despite its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The climate is characterized by persistent cloud cover which is a challenge for land cover mapping from optical satellite imagery. By using Google Earth Engine to select pixels with minimal cloud content and applying a random forest classifier to Landsat and Sentinel data, we produced a wall-to-wall land cover map, enabling a diagnosis of the status and drivers of forest loss in the region. Analyses of these new maps together with information from illicit crops and alluvial mining uncovered the pressure over intact forests. According to Global Forest Change (GFC) data, 2324 km2 were deforested in this area from 2001 to 2018, reaching a maximum in 2016 and 2017. We found that 68% of the area is covered by broadleaf forests (67,473 km2) and 15% by shrublands (14,483 km2), the latter with enormous potential to promote restoration projects. This paper provides a new insight into the conservation of this exceptional forest with a discussion of the drivers of forest loss, where illicit crops and alluvial mining were found to be responsible for 60% of forest loss. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity hotspot; Deforestation; Google earth engine; Landsat; Sentinel; Tropical humid forests","Biodiversity; Crops; Decision making; Decision trees; Deforestation; Satellite imagery; Broadleaf forest; Decision making process; Forest management policies; Land cover mapping; Optical satellite imagery; Random forest classifier; Restoration project; Tropical forest; Conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084602080"

Cognizant of the environmental changes prevailing in the pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Southern Ethiopia, we have examined the past conversion of woodland to other land uses through the analysis of Landsat Multi-spectral scanner (MSS) 1973, Thematic Mapper(TM) 1986, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) 2003, Operational Land Imagery (OLI) 2017 and then projected the future change in land use/cover (LUC) as well. We have employed Cellular Automata Markov chain model to simulate and predict LUC changes between 2017 and 2060. Four spatial driver variables such as distance to road and settlement, slope and elevation were used to run the simulation. Prior to the prediction, we have simulated the LUC of 2017 using transition potential maps of 2003 and transition matrix between 1973 and 2003. The predictive power of the model was then examined by comparing the reference and simulated LUC maps of 2017and also using the kappa index. A good correlation was obtained between the reference and simulated LUC maps of 2017. In addition, the computed kappa index was above 0.9, which implies that the model is effective in predicting change in LUC. The analysis result revealed that in the entire monitoring period (1973–2017) the area lost 89,875 ha of woodland. The loss is expected to continue during the period 2017–2060, with an estimated loss of 32,423 ha of woodland, if a proper measure is not taken against the continuous loss of woodland. Thus, relentless efforts are needed to rehabilitate the already degraded land and also minimize the potential loss of woodland in the future through the implementation of conservation – livelihood approach, REDD + project, and sustainable land use management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CA-Markov; Deforestation; Kappa coefficient; Woodland","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084369924"

Fusion of optical and radar images has been found useful in tropical areas affected by cloud cover because of their complementarity. However, the multitemporal dimension these data now offer is often neglected because these areas are primarily characterized by relatively low levels of seasonality and because the consideration of multitemporal data requires more processing time. Hence, land cover mapping in these regions is often based on imagery acquired for a single date or on an average of multiple dates. The aim of this work is to assess the added value brought by the temporal dimension of optical and radar time series when mapping land cover in tropical environments. Specifically, we compared the accuracies of classifications based on (a) optical time series, (b) their temporal average, (c) radar time series, (d) their temporal average, (e) a combination of optical and radar time series and (f) a combination of their temporal averages for mapping land cover in Jambi province, Indonesia, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Using the full information contained in the time series resulted in significantly higher classification accuracies than using temporal averages (+14.7% for Sentinel-1, +2.5% for Sentinel-2 and +2% combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2). Overall, combining Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series provided the highest accuracies (Kappa = 88.5%). Our study demonstrates that preserving the temporal information provided by satellite image time series can significantly improve land cover classifications in tropical biodiversity hotspots, improving our capacity to monitor ecosystems of high conservation relevance such as peatlands. The proposed method is reproducible, automated and based on open-source tools satellite imagery. © 2020 British Ecological Society","cloud persistent areas; conservation; data combination; land cover classification; remote sensing; satellite image time series; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","","Note","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080078853"

To effectively anticipate the challenges posed by urbanization, participatory modeling techniques can help to stimulate future-oriented decision-making by exploring alternative development scenarios. With the example of the coastal city of Monastir, we present the results of an integrated urban growth analysis that combines the SLEUTH (slope, land use, exclusion, urban extent, transportation, and hill shade) cellular automata model with qualitative inputs from relevant local stakeholders to simulate urban growth until 2030. While historical time-series of Landsat data fed a business-as-usual prediction, the quantification of narrative storylines derived from participatory scenario workshops enabled the creation of four additional urban growth scenarios. Results show that the growth of the city will occur at different rates under all scenarios. Both the “business-as-usual” (BaU) prediction and the four scenarios revealed that urban expansion is expected to further encroach on agricultural land by 2030. The various scenarios suggest that Monastir will expand between 127–149 hectares. The information provided here goes beyond simply projecting past trends, giving decision-makers the necessary support for both understanding possible future urban expansion pathways and proactively managing the future growth of the city. © 2020 by the authors.","alternative scenarios; Business as Usual prediction; future urban expansion; participatory modeling; SLEUTH","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124142268"

However, conservation goals are threatened by growing demands for agricultural products. As the expansion of agricultural frontiers continues to exert increasing pressure on forest cover, it is crucial to provide indicators on forest vulnerability to improve our understanding of forest dynamics and prioritize management actions by local decision-makers. The purpose of this study is to develop a rigorous methodological framework to assess forest ecological vulnerability. We aim at evaluating the potential of remote sensing to characterize forest landscape dynamics in spatial and temporal dimensions. We present an innovative method that spatially integrates current landscape mosaic mapping with 45 years of landscape trajectories using Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. We derive indicators of exposure to cropland expansion, sensitivity linked with forest degradation and fragmentation, and forest capacity to respond based on forest landscape composition in Di Linh district in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. We map current forest-agricultural mosaics with high accuracy to assess landscape intensification (kappa index = 0.78). We also map the expansion of the agricultural frontier and highlighted heterogeneous agricultural encroachment on forested areas (kappa index = 0.72-0.93). Finally, we identify degradation and fragmentation trajectories that affect forest cover at different rates and intensity. Combined, these indicators pinpoint hotspots of forest vulnerability. This study provides tailored management responses and levers for action by local decision makers. The accessibility of multi-dimensional remote sensing data and the developed landscape approach open promising perspectives for continuously monitoring agricultural frontiers. © 2019","Deforestation; Ecological vulnerability; Forest degradation; Landscape approach; Vietnam","agricultural production; decision making; deforestation; environmental degradation; expansion; forest dynamics; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; vulnerability; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082926173"

More importantly, the tropical forest in Kalimantan is mostly covered by peatlands at risk of forest fires. Historical data showed that most of the fire events happened in Central Kalimantan. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, around 22,35% of burned forest areas in Indonesia during 2015 forest fire cases happened in Central Kalimantan. While in the 2019 Indonesian forest fires, around 19,26% of burned forest areas also happened in Central Kalimantan. One of the leading causes of forest fires is the dryness of peatland that the lower part of it is incredibly prone to be a source of the fire. This heat source, called fire alerts, can be seen using thermal-based infrared sensors from satellite imagery. Long dry season with a low rainfall rate was suspected as the main cause of many fire alerts in the lower part of peatland. We retrieved and processed rainfall data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) as an input to calculate the dryness classification using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), as well as fire alerts data from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) satellite imagery during 2015 - 2019. This research aims to analyze the relationship between the dryness peatland condition and the intensity of fire alerts by generating a correlation graph between drought on a long dry season and fire alerts generated from VIIRS.

But human intervention such as logging, peatland draining and conversion of natural ecosystems into plantation and small holder agriculture area has made natural ecosystems in the humid tropical insular Southeast Asia vulnerable to fires. During the past decades, vegetation fires in tropical regions have attracted attentions and become an important global environmental issue. The peatlands of Sumatra, especially in the provinces of Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra, have been the main fire areas. In this study we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire hotspots, peatland distribution maps and a peatland land cover map to investigate the temporal and spatial distributions and characteristics of fire activity in this region in 2019. We also compared the characteristics of fire distribution in 2019 with the previous 10 years from 2009 to 2018. Our results shown that nearly two third (63.5%) of the fires were located in peatlands that covered 27.25% of the three provinces. The peatland fire density was 4.6 times that of the mineral soils. The hotspots in 2019 were mainly contributed by industrial plantations and small holder areas as in the previous years. However, there was evidence of increasing fire activities in the less managed land cover classes of ferns/low shrub and previously cleared land areas. They were found to have the highest hotspots density suggesting increased land conversion activities in these areas. The total number of hotspots (26627) detected in 2019 was only slightly higher than the average over the previous 10 years. However, the fire season in 2019 lasted until November, unlike the previous 10 years. The longer fire season was due to the dryer and hotter month of November in 2019. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

In cities lying in Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia, air pollution is a result of urbanization growth e.g. construction and industrialization. Brick kilns, factories that make construction bricks, are significant pollutant emitters due to excessive coal usage. Being an unregulated industry, brick kilns are often overlooked in emission inventories due to non-availability of brick kiln locations. We propose a remote sensing-based approach to prepare brick-kiln location map over large-area that can be used in emission inventories in North India. In this paper we used unique features of brick kilns of the bull trench kiln (BK) type to identify them in open remote sensing dataset - Sentinel 2. This is an 'automatic target recognition' problem in which deep learning-based approaches have been very promising. To overcome requirement of huge training dataset for deep learning-based target recognition, we used transfer learning and fine-tuning approach to achieve recognition with a small dataset of 200 samples per class. Apart from the brick-kiln, urban, vegetation and fallow land samples were also prepared for training. Publicly available data: 10 meter resolution Sentinel-2 optical imagery was used for deep learning followed by use of PALSAR for post-processing. Over the region lying of east of New Delhi a hotspot of brick kilns exist that serve to the construction activities in surrounding regions. The brick kiln's producer accuracy with the use of publicly available satellite data was 72.3% and user accuracy was 99.1%. We find the brick kilns are located in those where horizontal or vertical urban growth is taking place. By analyzing the NDVI over the brick kiln locations, their age of operation and impact on operations due to governmental policies could also be estimated. These brick kiln locations can be further used for land-use emission inventories to assess PM2.5 and black carbon emissions as well as their concentration by chemical transport modeling. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

Spatial-temporal analysis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, as well as the monitoring and modeling of urban expansion, are essential for the planning and management of urban environments. Such environments reflect the economic conditions and quality of life of the individual country. Urbanization is generally influenced by national laws, plans, and policies and by power, politics, and governance in many developing countries. Remote sensing tools play a vital role in monitoring LULC change and measuring the rate of urbanization at both the local and global levels. This paper monitored the changes of the urban suitability area, and prediction of LULC with urban growth using multi-criteria decision analysis and cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain model. The province of Orkhon is the most intensive development area in Mongolia, and a transitional zone on urban area expansion with residential, mining, and industries, where is sampled in this study. The methods are provided by the urban suitability area based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with factor variables and simulation of LULC based on the CA-Markov chain model. The urban suitability area analysis is helpful to validate the prediction of an urban area by relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The CA-Markov chain model was calibrated with data from 1989 to 2019 and used to predict expansions for 2030 and 2040 with two datasets of explanatory variables including slope, forest, river, specially protected areas, road, railroad, and urban centers in an urban and non-urban area. All analyses were based on Landsat imageries (TM, ETM+, and OLI) that were used to derive main land use classes. The results show that the urban, agriculture and mining area were expanded intensively. Forest was decreased in the last few years caused by human influences. Besides, the simulation results were validated by ROC curves with urban suitability analysis. Finally, this kind of study results is very important and useful to land managers and urban planners. © 2020 SPIE.","Cellular automata (CA); Land use land cover (LULC); Markov chain; Orkhon Mongolia; Urban expansion","Agricultural robots; Analytic hierarchy process; Cellular automata; Conservation; Developing countries; Forecasting; Forestry; Land use; Markov chains; Remote sensing; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Explanatory variables; Land use/land cover change; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Relative operating characteristics; Remote sensing tools; Spatial temporal analysis; Suitability analysis; Urban growth","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094938247"

Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of soil pH is thus important for sustainable land use planning and management. In this study, we developed an approach based on geographically weighted regression-kriging (GWRK) to predict the continuous variation of soil pH up to 15 cm depth. The approach is compared to multiple linear regression-kriging (MLRK) using a total of 220 soil observations and 28 candidate auxiliary data, including climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed data. Results revealed that organic matter, sand, silt, temperature, and Landsat 8 operational land imager band 7 can explain the spatial variability of soil pH. GWR-based (local) models remarkably improved the prediction accuracy of soil pH compared to the MLR-based (global) models considering the root mean square error (i.e., 0.33 vs. 0.15; 0.37 vs. 0.17, respectively) and the coefficient of multiple determination (R2) (i.e., 0.59 vs. 0.74; 0.43 vs. 0.55, respectively). In conclusion, the use of GWR-based models revealed that the correlations between soil pH and environmental covariates were not stationary in space. Forested areas tended to be very strongly to moderately acidic, while croplands were slightly acidic to neutral. The GWR-based models demonstrated their utility in improving predictive soil mapping. These findings will support spatially-targeted soil pH management for improved food security and ecosystem health. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Digital soil mapping; Geographically weighted regression; Multiple linear regression; Soil pH; Spatial prediction; Spatial variability","digital mapping; kriging; landscape; multiple regression; pH; prediction; remote sensing; soil; spatial variation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076364457"

Selective logging concessions overlay a third of the remaining natural forests in the Indonesian part of Borneo, but many of these concessions have become inactive in recent years. Whereas the cessation of logging could be beneficial to biodiversity, the absence of a logging company's presence in the forest could also leave the concession open to deforestation by other actors. Using remote sensing analyses, we evaluate 1) whether inactive concessions are more likely to suffer from deforestation than active ones, 2) the possible reasons why concessions become inactive, and 3) which inactive concessions hold the most potential for biodiversity conservation, if protected from deforestation. Our analysis shows that, counterintuitively, inactive concessions overall suffer a higher rate of forest loss than active ones. We find that small concession size and high elevation are correlated with inactive status. We identified several inactive concessions that, if maintained as natural forest, could significantly contribute to biodiversity conservation, as exemplified by their importance to two umbrella species: Bornean orangutan (Critically Endangered) and Sunda clouded leopard (Vulnerable). Because timber operations in other tropical regions are likely to experience similar cycles of activity and inactivity, the fate of inactive timber concessions and the opportunities they create for conservation deserve much greater attention from conservation scientists and practitioners. © 2019 The Authors","","biodiversity; conservation management; deforestation; endangered species; felid; logging (timber); remote sensing; vulnerability; Borneo; Neofelis nebulosa; Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076244393"

This work mainly focuses on the changes in hotspot zones, UHIs during two different seasons - winter and summer. An attempt has been made to study the spatiotemporal variation in the urban heat islands (UHIs) and their relationship with LULC during 2000–2018, over Chandigarh (30° 43′ 59″ N, 76° 46′ 46″ E), a planned sub-tropical Indian city, using the remote sensing techniques. The indices such as Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), Dry Built-up Index (DBI) and Dry Bare-Soil Index (DBSI) are employed to differentiate the built-up areas (BA) from the drylands (DL) effectively. The changes observed in the LULC reveals an increase of 10% in the BA at the expense of the vegetation during 2000–2018, which is in close agreement with the EBBI, DBI and DBSI assessments. A steady increase is observed in the UHI intensities for both summer and winter seasons during the study period.

Rising temperatures, weather conditions, and topography promote the incidences of fire due to human ignition in South Asia. Because of its synoptic, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal nature, remote sensing data can be a state of art technology for forest fire management. This study focuses on the spatio-temporal patterns of forest fires and identifying hotspots using the novel geospatial technique “emerging hotspot analysis tool” in South Asia. Daily MODIS active fire locations data of 15 years (2003–2017) has been aggregated in order to characterize fire frequency, fire density, and hotspots. A total of 522,348 active fire points have been used to analyze risk of fires across the forest types. Maximum number of forest fires in South Asia was occurring during the January to May. Spatial analysis identified areas of frequent burning and high fire density in South Asian countries. In South Asia, 51% of forest grid cells were affected by fires in 15 years. Highest number of fire incidences was recorded in tropical moist deciduous forest and tropical dry deciduous forest. The emerging hotspots analysis indicates prevalence of sporadic hotspots, followed by historical hotspots, consecutive hotspots, and persistent hotspots in South Asia. Of the seven South Asian countries, Bangladesh has highest emerging hotspot area (34.2%) in forests, followed by 32.2% in India and 29.5% in Nepal. Study results offer critical insights in delineation of fire vulnerable forest landscapes which will stand as a valuable input for strengthening management of fires in South Asia. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Density; Emerging; Forest; Frequency; Hotspots, MODIS","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Density (specific gravity); Fire hazards; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Topography; Tropics; Dry deciduous forests; Emerging; Forest; Forest fire management; Frequency; Hotspots; Spatiotemporal patterns; State-of-art technology; Fires; biodiversity; forest fire; frequency analysis; MODIS; spatial variation; temporal variation; Afghanistan; Article; Bangladesh; Bhutan; geography; incidence; India; landscape; Maldives; Nepal; Pakistan; South Asia; spatiotemporal analysis; Sri Lanka; Asia; environmental monitoring; fire; forest; tree; wildfire; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Trees; Wildfires","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078340890"

These depend on complex social and ecological interactions that manifest on different space–time scales and are commonly evaluated through regression analysis of multivariate datasets. However, processing such datasets is challenging, especially when time series are used and inconsistencies in data collection complicate their integration. Moreover, regression analysis in FDD characterization has been criticized for failing to capture spatial variability; therefore, alternatives such as geographically weighted regression (GWR) have been proposed, but their sensitivity to multicollinearity has not yet been solved. In this scenario, we present an innovative methodology that combines techniques to: 1) derive remote sensing time series products; 2) improve census processing with dasymetric mapping; 3) combine GWR and random forest (RF) to derive local variables importance; and 4) report results based in a clustering and hypothesis testing. We applied this methodology in the northwestern Ecuadorian Amazon, a highly heterogeneous region characterized by different active fronts of deforestation and reforestation, within the time period 2000–2010. Our objective was to identify linkages between these processes and validate the potential of the proposed methodology. Our findings indicate that land-use intensity proxies can be extracted from remote sensing time series, while intercensal analysis can be facilitated by calculating population density maps. Moreover, our implementation of GWR with RF achieved accurate predictions above the 74% using the out-of-bag samples, demonstrating that derived RF features can be used to construct hypothesis and discuss forest change drivers with more detailed information. In the other hand, our analysis revealed contrasting effects between deforestation and reforestation for variables related to suitability to agriculture and accessibility to its facilities, which is also reflected according patch size, land cover and population dynamics patterns. This approach demonstrates the benefits of integrating remote sensing–derived products and socioeconomic data to understand coupled socioecological systems more from a local than a global scale. © 2019 Santos et al.

For most tropical zones, deforestation rates are averaged across entire countries, often without highlighting regional differentiation. There are also very few estimates of forest degradation, either averaged or localized for the tropics. We quantified regional and country-wide changes in deforestation and forest degradation rates for Madagascar from Landsat temporal data (in two intervals, 1994–2002 and 2002–2014). To our knowledge, this is the first country-wide estimate of forest degradation for Madagascar. We also performed an intensity analysis to categorize the magnitude and speed of transitions between forest, vegetation matrix, cultivated land and exposed surface. We found significant regional heterogeneity in deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation rates decreased annually in lowland evergreen moist forest by −0.24% and in all other vegetation zones. Forest degradation rates had annual increases in the same period in lowland evergreen moist forest (0.09%), littoral forest (0.06%) but decreased in medium altitude moist evergreen forest (−0.25%), dry deciduous forest (−0.23%) and scelrophyllous woodland (−0.61%) in the same period. Despite these regional differences, higher rates of deforestation and forest degradation were consistently driven by rapid and large-sized conversions of largely intact forest to cultivated lands and exposed surfaces, most of which occurred between 1994 and 2002. These results suggest that while targeted conservation projects may have reduced forest degradation rates in some areas (e.g. medium altitude moist evergreen forest), the drivers of land cover change remain intense in relatively neglected regions. We advocate a more balanced approach to future conservation initiatives, one recognizing that deforestation and forest degradation, particularly in tropical Africa, are often driven by region-specific conditions and therefore require conservation policies tailored for local conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

We find that by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, SSP 3 (regional rivalry/a rocky road), the region’s forests would shrink by 5.2 million ha. The region’s aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) would decrease by 790 Tg C, 21% of which would be due to old-growth forest loss.

The algorithm self-adapts to the local scattering conditions and it is robust to variations of input data availability. The algorithm applies the Reed-Xiaoli detector (RXD) to distinguish anomalous changes of the backscatter coefficient. Such changes are linked to fire events, which are derived from thermal anomalies (hotspots) acquired during the detection period by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Land cover maps were used to account for changing backscatter behaviour as the RXD is class dependent. A machine learning classifier (random forests) was used to detect burned areas where hotspots were not available. Burned area perimeters derived from optical images (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) were used to validate the algorithm results. The validation dataset covers 21 million hectares in 18 locations that represent the main biomes affected by fires, from boreal forests to tropical and sub-tropical forests and savannas.

Agriculture is a major component of the Egyptian economy and the country's main source of food security. Urbanization is devouring vast areas of agricultural land, and therefore, in the present study, urbanization was used to determine the degree of soil sealing in a region of Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. In this work, remote sensing data were used to monitor changes in land use and land cover (LULC) between 1984 and 2016. A field survey and population data were also used in the analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to produce LULC maps of the study area. An accuracy assessment was performed by calculating overall accuracy and individual kappa coefficients. Additionally, soil sealing was assessed using data from 1984 to 2016, and the potential expansion of soil sealing until 2048 was simulated using the cellular automata (CA)-Markov model. Our analysis showed that in the study area (i) about 90% of the soils had soil capability degrees between class II and class III; (ii) soil sealing was not uniformly distributed in the study area; (iii) between 1984 and 2016, the area of soil sealing in fertile soils due to urbanization increased by 19,500 hectares; and (iv) between 1984 and 2000, the urban area increased by around 29%, whereas between 2000 and 2010 it increased by around 43.6%. The results suggest that the magnitude of soil sealing is a good indicator of the soil loss rate and the potential for agricultural development in the Nile Delta. The model predicted that by 2048 an area of 32,290 hectares of agricultural soil will be lost to urbanization. This study indicates that the change of LULC has a negative impact on soil sealing. Between 2000 and 2010, the area of agricultural land decreased by 4%, despite an increase in land reclamation in the north of the study area. The amount of soil sealing was found to increase towards the southeast and northeast of the study area, except for the northern parts, where the amount of soil sealing increased towards the east. Our analyses and forecasts are useful for decision-makers responsible for soil-sealing mitigation strategies and soil-sealing protection plans in the Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. © 2019 by the authors.","GIS; Land use changes; Remote sensing; Simulation modeling; Sustainable development","agricultural development; agricultural land; agricultural soil; assessment method; cellular automaton; GIS; land reclamation; land use change; prediction; remote sensing; sealing; simulation; sustainable development; Egypt; Nile Delta","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071990820"

About 72% of the total forest area of Chhattisgarh state (59,935 km2) has shown a trend of negative change between the periods (1982 and 2006). Around 50% of the total forest fires of the state were found in the two tehsils of Narayanpur and Bijapur with two major forest fire hotspots. Approximately 86% of the total forest fire event of the state occurred in the category of “tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests” whereas the intensity of forest fire events was found 2.2 times in the category “tropical lowland forests, broadleaved, evergreen, < 1000 m” when it was compared with the category of “tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests.” The highest poverty percent was found in the tehsil of Bijapur (65.9%) which retains a significantly high percentage of the tribal population (73.1%). The adaptive capacity of Raipur tehsil (state capital) is high whereas it reduces significantly towards north and south from the state capital. The climate anomaly data evaluation for the year 2030 showed variation such as reduction in rainfall and increase in temperature will significantly maneuver the forest fire regime in future is a matter of serious concern.

Ghana is no exception and a high population growth rate, coupled with economic development over the last three decades, has transformed the Greater Accra region into a hotspot for massive urban growth. The urban extent of the region has expanded extensively, mainly at the expense of the vegetative cover in the region. Although urbanization presents several opportunities, the environmental and social problems cannot be underestimated. Therefore, the need to estimate the rate and extent of land use/land cover changes in the region and the main drivers of these changes is imperative. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques provide effective tools in studying and monitoring land-use/land-cover change over space and time. A post classification change detection of multiple Landsat images was conducted to map and analyse the extent and rate of land use/land cover change in the region between 1991 and 2015. Subsequently, the urban extent of the region was forecasted for the year 2025 using the Markov Chain and the Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network, together with drivers representing proximity, biophysical, and socio-economic variables. The results from the research revealed that built-up areas increased by 277% over the 24-year study period. However, forest areas experienced massive reduction, diminishing from 34% in 1991 to 6.5% in 2015. The 2025 projected land use map revealed that the urban extent will massively increase to cover 70% of the study area, as compared to 44% in 2015. The urban extent is also anticipated to spill into the adjoining districts mainly on the western and eastern sides of the region. The success of this research in generating a future land-use map for 2025, together with the other significant findings, demonstrates the usefulness of spatial models as tools for sustainable city planning and environmental management, especially for urban planners in developing countries. © 2019 by the authors.","Accra; land use/land cover; Markov Chain; multi-layer perceptron neural network; urban growth simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069684190"

Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressão Cárstica do São Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piauí), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users.

Ideally, deforestation monitoring systems would identify a TDF clearing with near real time precision and high spatial detail, and alert park managers and environmental practitioners of illegal forest clearings occurring anywhere in a region of interest. Over the past several years there have been significant advances in the design and application of continuous land cover change mapping algorithms with these capabilities, but no studies have implemented such methods over human dominated TDF environments where small–scale deforestation (<5 ha) is widespread and hard to detect with moderate resolution sensors. The general objective for this research was to evaluate the overall accuracy of the BFASTSpatial R Package for detecting and monitoring small-scale deforestation in four sites located in tropical dry forest landscapes of Mexico and Costa Rica using greenness and moisture spectral indices derived from Landsat time series. Results show a high degree of spatial agreement (90%–94%) between the distribution of TDF clearings occurred during the 2013–2016 period (as indicated by VHR imagery interpretation) and BFASTSpatial outputs. NDMI and NBR2 had the best performance than other indices and this is evidenced by the combined overall, user's and producer's accuracies. In particular, NBR2 were the most accurate predictor of deforestation with an overall accuracy of 94.5%. Our results also imply that monitoring sites at an annual basis is feasible using BFASTSpatial and LTS, but that lower confidence should be given to sub-annual products given significant systematic temporal differences between the BFASTSpatial monthly product and reference data. The possibility of including more clear observations at the spatial resolution of Landsat (30-m) or higher will greatly increase the spatial and temporal accuracies of the method. Given its performance, BFASTSpatial can help monitor hotspots of small-scale TDF loss across Central and North America at little or no cost. Users of the method should have a strong knowledge of the local land use and land cover dynamics and the ecophysiology of vegetation types present in the landscape. This local expertise is necessary for interpreting and validating results as well as communicating its output to decision-makers and stakeholders. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Change detection; Deforestation; Remote sensing; Tropical dry forests","Conformal mapping; Decision making; Image segmentation; Land use; Real time systems; Remote sensing; Time series; Tropics; Change detection; Design and application; Land use and land cover; Landsat time series; Mapping algorithms; Moderate resolution; Temporal differences; Tropical dry forest; Deforestation; decision making; deforestation; dry forest; ecophysiology; land cover; land use; Landsat; real time; remote sensing; spatial resolution; stakeholder; time series; tropical environment; Costa Rica; Mexico [North America]","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058640280"

Landsat images of 1986, 1990, 2002 and 2016 were classified into four dominant land use categories in the study area: cultivation, mine, forest and settlement using maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Land use change was determined by deriving pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict transition matrix. Based on the transition matrix, gain, loss, persistence, total change, swap and absolute value of net change were computed. Intensity of land use change was determined using the intensity analysis approach. The results show that the intensity of land use change was slow during the conflict but increased sharply after the conflict. Pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict mine occupied 0.63%, 0.78% and 17.68%, forest cover accounted for 71.08%, 69.26% and 56.42% and settlement was 1.99%, 1.96% and 25.63% respectively. Similarly, pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict uniform intensity of land use change was 4.09%, 1.51% and 5.01% respectively. Recent forest cover loss is primarily driven by sustained settlement expansion. The implications of rapid post-conflict settlement increase and forest loss in northern Nimba County include threat to habitat in a globally important biodiversity hotspot, increasing pressure on available agricultural land because of increasing population and potential exposure of the population to pollution from increase in mining activities. Therefore, more effective forest management strategies need to be developed to mitigate the prevailing trend. The use of intensity analysis has provided insights on the patterns and processes of pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict land use change in a biodiversity hotspot.

The CA (Cellular Automata) based SLEUTH model has been used in the present study for urban growth modelling, which is one of the most promising urban growth model and widely used throughout the world.

Three thematic maps (1986, 2001 and 2017) were produced by using pixel-based unsupervised classification techniques of Landsat images. LULC maps for 2017, 2033 and 2050 were modeled using a Cellular Automata Markov chain, validating their predictive power using Kappa variations. The InVEST software was used to estimate the carbon stored in four reservoirs, analyzing their variations over time (1986–2050). Accuracy assessment for the classifications revealed satisfactory results with an Overall accuracy of 83% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.76. Results show that the main landscape modifier was the exposed soils class increasing by 65% its extent in 1986, with a net increase around 87,900 ha. The evergreen forest (EF) and the tropical dry forest (TDF) classes showed a decrease along the period analyzed, displaying a net loss of 57,200 ha and 47,200 ha, respectively. Projected land cover changes followed the same trend observed, with a decreasing tendency in the EF and TDF coverages as consequence of exposed soil class increase. This change implies a reduction in the estimated total carbon stock, decreasing from 362.9 Tg C in 1986, to 336.2 Tg C in 2017. According to our model, if the trend detected in this analysis continues, it is expected a reduction to 317.9 Tg C in 2050. This approach combining Cellular Automata and Markov chain analysis with the InVEST model provides elements to estimate changes on carbon storage resulting from landscape changes. It also allows the identification of potential changes in the selected land use classes, providing with technical elements that could help to decision makers to better maintain the ecological integrity of the drainage basin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon storage; Cellular Automata; Change detection; Land cover modeling; Markov chain; Tropical dry forest","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058775170"

This research uses Landsat images and a Random Forest classifier (RF) to map old-growth, secondary, and plantation forests and to evaluate changes in their coverage in Ecuador. We used 46 Landsat-derived predictors from the dry and wet seasons to map these forest types and to evaluate the importance of having seasonal variables in classifications. Initial RF models grouped old-growth and secondary forest as a single class because of a lack of secondary forest training data. The model accuracy was improved slightly from 92.8% for the wet season and 94.6% for the dry season to 95% overall by including variables from both seasons. Derived land cover maps indicate that the remaining forest in the landscape occurs mostly along the coastline in a matrix of pastureland, with less than 10% of the landscape covered by plantation forests. To obtain secondary forest training data and evaluate changes in forest cover, we conducted a change analysis between the 1990 and 2015 images. The results indicated that half of the forests present in 1990 were cleared during the 25-year study period and highlighted areas of forest regrowth. We used these areas to extract secondary forest training data and then re-classified the landscape with secondary forest as a class. Classification accuracies decreased with more forest classes, but having data from both seasons resulted in higher accuracy (87.9%) compared to having data from only the wet (85.8%) or dry (82.9%) seasons. The produced cover maps classified the majority of previously identified forest areas as secondary, but these areas likely correspond to forest regrowth and to degraded forests that structurally resemble secondary forests. Among the few areas classified as old-growth forests are known reserves. This research provides evidence of the importance of using bi-seasonal Landsat data to classify forest types and contributes to understanding changes in forest cover of tropical dry forests. © 2018 by the authors.","Fragmented landscape; Old-growth forest; Plantation forest; Random forests; Secondary forest; Tropical dry forest","Biodiversity; Decision trees; Tropics; Fragmented landscapes; Old-growth forest; Plantation forests; Random forests; Secondary forests; Tropical dry forest; Forestry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058886394"

Although tropical rainforest covers over 88% of the study area, supervised classification of Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager (OLI) images identified eight other classes of land cover (LC) (mixed agriculture, hill paddy, wet paddy, bushes/shrubs/grasses, exposed barren land, artificial surface, pebbles / cobbles and waterbody) with an overall classification accuracy above 80%. Maximum rate of soil loss estimated from the study area through Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was 1312 t ha−1y−1 and the result aided the identification of regions with critical soil erosion vulnerability. Mean soil erosion rate in the study area was assessed to be 27 t ha−1 y−1. The zones with higher soil erosion rates exceed 25 t ha−1y−1 and amounted to a total area of 11%. Critical erosion zones (> 50 t ha−1 y−1) were found to cover 8% and show linear characteristics which is innate of logging roads and skid trails. At the same time, over 64% of the study area showed low erosion risk with soil losses lower than 5 t ha−1 y−1. Assessment made through geospatial overlay indicates dominance of four LC classes in contributing to soil erosion vulnerability and erosion rates. These are exposed barren land, secondary forest, bushes/shrubs and mixed agriculture. Field assessments confirmed the critical role of logging and hill paddy cultivation, which alter the natural terrain conditions and remove the forest cover. Although forest clearing for hill paddy cultivation removes vegetation and hence decreases protection against erosive rainfall, the sediment delivery will be relatively low due to less terrain alteration. Logging and associated activities induce the formation of soil erosion hotspots, which remain as such for several years. Logging activities generate exposed barren land which although only covers over 4% of the study area contributes more than 28% of the total soil loss. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Borneo; Land cover; Logging; RUSLE; Soil erosion; Terrain alteration","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053824925"

Therefore, researchers have focused on detection of land cover–land use changes (LCLUC) with respect to monitoring and mitigating the potential soil erosion. This article aims to appraise the relationship between LCLUC and soil erosion in the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia) by using multitemporal satellite images and ancillary data. Land clearing and heavy rainfall events in the study area has resulted in increased soil loss. Moreover, unsustainable development and agricultural practices, mismanagement, and lack of land use policies increase the soil erosion rate. Hence, the main contribution of this study lies in the application of appropriate land management practices in relation to water erosion through identification and prediction of the impacts of LCLUC on the spatial distribution of potential soil loss in a region susceptible to natural hazards such as landslide. The LCLUC distribution within the study area was mapped for 2005, 2010, and 2015 by using SPOT-5 temporal satellite imagery and object-based image classification. A projected land cover–land use map was also produced for 2025 through integration of Markov chain and cellular automata models. An empirical-based approach (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) coupled with geographic information system was applied to measure soil loss and susceptibility to erosion over the study area for four periods (2005, 2010, 2015, and 2025). The model comprises five parameters, namely, rainfall factor, soil erodibility, topographical factor, conservation factor, and support practice factor. Results exhibited that the average amount of soil loss increased by 31.77 t ha−1 yr−1 from 2005 to 2015 and was predicted to dramatically increase in 2025. The results generated from this research recommends that awareness of spatial and temporal patterns of high soil loss risk areas can help deploy site-specific soil conservation measures and erosion mitigation processes and prevent unsystematic deforestation and urbanization by the authorities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cameron Highlands; GIS; LCLUC; remote sensing; soil loss estimation","Catchments; Deforestation; Erosion; Geographic information systems; Land use; Markov processes; Rain; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Satellite imagery; Sediment transport; Soils; Tropics; Cameron highlands; Land management practices; LCLUC; Multi-temporal satellite images; Object-based image classification; Revised universal soil loss equations; Soil loss; Spatial and temporal patterns; Soil conservation; catchment; erosion rate; GIS; land cover; land degradation; land use change; remote sensing; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; satellite imagery; soil conservation; soil erosion; SPOT; tropical region; Cameron Highlands; Malaysia; Pahang; West Malaysia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051729518"

In developing countries, ongoing economic and demographic growth within Hotspots can alter rates and patterns of deforestation, making it a concern to quantify rates of forest loss and assess landscape-scale correlates of deforestation within Hotspots. Such analyses can help set baselines for future monitoring and provide landscape-scale perspectives to design conservation policy. For the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot in India, we examined correlates of forest loss following rapid economic expansion (post-2000 CE). First, we used open-source remote-sensing data to estimate annual trends in recent forest loss (from 2000 to 2016) for the entire Hotspot. Across the entire Western Ghats, we assessed the relative importance of and interactions among demographic, administrative, and biophysical factors that predicted rates of forest loss—measured as the number of 30 × 30-m pixels of forest lost within randomly selected 1 km2 cells. Protected areas reduced forest loss by 30%, especially when forests were closer to roads (33%) and towns (36%). However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased, implying that the difference in forest loss between protected and non-protected areas disappears at high local population densities. To check scale-dependency of spatial extent, we repeated the modelling process for two landscape subsets within Western Ghats. In contrast with results for the entire Western Ghats, both focal landscapes showed no difference in deforestation with protection status alone or its interactions with village population density and distance to towns. However, deforestation was 88% lower when forests were protected and farther from roads. Overall, our results indicate that protected areas help retain forest cover within a global Biodiversity Hotspot even with rapid development, but high human population densities and road development can reduce the benefits of protection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity hotspot; Forest loss; Human population; Protected areas; Roads; Tropical forest; Western Ghats","annual variation; biodiversity; deforestation; developing world; forest cover; population density; protected area; remote sensing; road; trend analysis; tropical forest; India; Western Ghats","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046730746"

However, information on the temporal and spatial dynamics of TDF deforestation or disturbance is scarce. In this study, we present a national and sub-national level assessment of TDF loss patterns in Mexico and Central America at high spatial and temporal resolution using remote sensing and GIS technologies. We used the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset published by Hansen et al. (2013) which shows detected forest loss at 30-m pixel resolution at interannual rates from 2000 through 2013. We analyzed TDF loss within a peer reviewed moderate resolution map of TDF extent based on 2004 satellite imagery, eliminated potential sources of errors and enforced all polygons to correspond to forest loss only within TDF dominated cover. We analyzed trends in the magnitude of deforestation (total forest loss area) and TDF loss patch size as well as density of forest loss across the region. We also investigated the spatial pattern of increasing or decreasing temporal trends of forest loss by applying a space-time hotspot analysis. For the 2001–2013 period, we identified five areas where TDF loss was high and had the tendency to increase; while widespread low TDF loss with the tendency to decrease was found across most Central America countries and most of the Pacific coast of Mexico. Contextual and underlying causative factors vary, conforming to cultural and socioeconomic differences across the region, with rural migration, small-scale agricultural expansion, agricultural intensification, oil palm expansion and cattle ranching amongst the main causes of TDF conversion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Central America; Deforestation; GIS; Mexico; Tropical dry forests","data set; deforestation; dry forest; GIS; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; tropical forest; Central America; Mexico [North America]; Bos; Elaeis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044112327"

Among various aspects of urban sustainability, environmental protection such as agricultural and forest conservations is very important in tropical countries like Malaysia. In this regard, compact urban development due to high density, rural development containment is known as the most sustainable urban forms. This paper attempts to propose an integrated modeling approach to predict the future land use changes by considering city compactness paradigms. First, the cellular automata (CA) were applied for calculating land use conversion. Next, weights-of-evidence (WoE) which is based on Bayes theory was utilized to calibrate CA model and to support the transitional rule assessment. Several urban-related parameters as well as compact city indicators were utilized to estimate the future land use maps. The results showed how compact development parameters and site characteristics can be combined using the WoE model to predict the probability of land use changes. The modeling approach supports the essential logic of probabilistic methods and indicates that spatial autocorrelation of various land use types and accessibility is the main drivers of urban land use changes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cellular automata; Compact city; GIS; Land use change modeling; Remote sensing","Cellular automata; Conservation; Decision making; Forestry; Land use; Regional planning; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Compact city; Integrated modeling approaches; Land use change modeling; Probabilistic methods; Spatial autocorrelations; Urban land-use change; Urban sustainability; Weights of evidences; Geographic information systems; accessibility; calibration; cellular automaton; compaction; environmental protection; GIS; land use change; parameterization; population density; probability; remote sensing; rural development; urban development; Malaysia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044300191"

This volcanic range has a high degree of heterogeneity in its geology, climate and ecology, in addition to a very long history of human occupation. The original area covered by tropical forest has been drastically reduced by agricultural activities, and during the last four decades in particular, deforestation has been very intense. In order to protect the remaining forest, in 1998 the Mexican government created the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve (LTBR). While previous studies estimated deforestation rates and the amount of forest cover remaining in some areas of the LTBR, this is the first study to do so for the entire protected area. A retrospective analysis from 1986 to 2011 was conducted to assess the effect of the 1998 decree of the LTBR on deforestation rates, and to predict future changes in forest cover up to the year 2025 using Markov chains and cellular automata based on current deforestation patterns. The results show that shortly after the 1998 decree, deforestation rates in the LTBR not only decreased but reversed, however this trend did not continue. In recent years deforestation has again increased. Our projection shows that if current trends continue unchanged then by the year 2025 we might have lost close to 14% (ca. 9000 ha) of the forest cover that was present in 2011. The decree of the LTBR was part of the federal policy to protect biodiversity in Mexico and our results show that the strategy of establishing this protected area did work to protect tropical forest, at least temporarily in Los Tuxtlas. Also, our results show that it is not only possible to reverse forest loss within the ample buffer zone of the LTBR, it is also still relatively easy to achieve by promoting passive restoration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","LANDSAT; Markov chains; Protected areas; Retrospective and predictive analysis","buffer zone; deforestation; forest cover; future prospect; Landsat; Markov chain; protected area; tropical forest; Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve; Mexico [North America]; Veracruz","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040241387"

Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala. Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala's primary crop species during 2003–2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy. Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry; Homegarden; Land-use management; Mixed methods; Tropical agriculture","agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural production; agroforestry; analytical method; cultivation; forest canopy; home garden; land management; land use change; land use planning; paddy field; remote sensing; tropical environment; wetland; India; Kerala; Gallus gallus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019147513"

Better understanding of land use and land cover (LULC) change will facilitate urban planning and constrain these potential problems. As one of the four municipalities in China, Tianjin has experienced rapid urbanization and such trend is expected to continue. Relying on remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) tools, this study investigates LULC change in Tianjin city. First, we used RS to generate classification maps for 1995, 2005, and 2015. Then, simulation models were applied to evaluate the LULC changes. Analysis of the 1995, 2005, and 2015 LULC maps shows that more than 10% of the cropland areas were transformed into built-up areas. Finally, by employing the Markov model and cellular automata (CA) model, the LULC in 2025 and 2035 were simulated and forecasted. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of the development process in the Tianjin area, which will facilitate future planning, as well as constraining the potential negative consequences brought by future LULC changes. © 2017 by the authors.","Cellular automata model; GIS; Markov model; Neighborhood interaction; Remote sensing; Urban growth","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019627753"

The purpose of this chapter is to describe briefly the methodology used to produce land use/cover maps, and simulate land use/cover changes for selected metropolitan areas in Asia and Africa. Land use/cover maps were classified from Landsat imagery for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2014 using the random forest (RF) classifier. Quantitative accuracy assessment was not conducted for the 1990 land use/cover maps due to lack of reference data. However, qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessment was performed for the 2000, 2010, and 2014 land use/cover maps based on Google Earth imagery. Overall land use/cover classification accuracy for all land use/cover maps ranged from 70 to 90%. Land use/cover changes were simulated based on the boosted regression trees-cellular automata (BRT-CA) and RF-CA LCMs. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit of transition potential maps, and validated the simulated land use/cover changes based on robust statistical measures. Generally, the BRT-CA and RF-CA LCMs for all metropolitan areas in Asia and Africa performed relatively well. In particular, the BRT-CA and RF-CA LCMs for metropolitan areas in Africa had the best performance. The modeling and simulation results presented in this chapter provide an initial exploration of BRT-CA and RF-CA LCMs in Asia and Africa. This chapter demonstrates the significance of robust calibration, validation, and simulation of spatial LCMs for all metropolitan areas in Asia and Africa. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cellular Automaton; Cellular Automaton; False Alarm; Land Change; Metropolitan Area","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139227297"

However, detection of short-term processes and land use patterns of high spatial–temporal variability is a challenging task. We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques, namely discriminative Markov random fields with spatio-temporal priors, and import vector machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Pará with land cover dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye, Landsat) for reference. Results show that land use land cover is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to 79% in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of different pasture types remain. The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Deforestation; Import vector machines (IVM); Markov random fields (MRF); Multi-temporal LULC mapping; SAR","deforestation; land cover; land use; Landsat; machine learning; Markov chain; RapidEye; satellite data; satellite imagery; shifting cultivation; support vector machine; TerraSAR-X; tropical forest; vegetation mapping; Brazil; Para [Brazil]","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032511097"

This study has quantified the total area under land cover types, estimated the rate of forest cover change, analyzed the changes across forest types, and modeled forest cover change hotpots in Bhutan. The topographical maps and satellite remote sensing images were analyzed to get the spatial patterns of forest and associated land cover changes over the past eight decades (1930–1977–1987–1995–2005–2014). Forest is the largest land cover in Bhutan and constitutes 68.3% of the total geographical area in 2014. Subtropical broad leaved hill forest is predominant type occupies 34.1% of forest area in Bhutan, followed by montane dry temperate (20.9%), montane wet temperate (18.9%), Himalayan moist temperate (10%), and tropical moist sal (8.1%) in 2014. The major forest cover loss is observed in subtropical broad leaved hill forest (64.5 km2) and moist sal forest (9.9 km2) from 1977 to 2014. The deforested areas have mainly been converted into agriculture and contributed for 60.9% of forest loss from 1930 to 2014. In spite of major decline of forest cover in time interval of 1930–1977, there is no net rate of deforestation is recorded in Bhutan since 1995. Forest cover change analysis has been carried out to evaluate the conservation effectiveness in “Protected Areas” of Bhutan. Hotspots that have undergone high transformation in forest cover for afforestation and deforestation were highlighted in the study for conservation prioritisation. Forest conservation policies in Bhutan are highly effective in controlling deforestation as compared to neighboring Asian countries and such service would help in mitigating climate change. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bhutan; Conservation; Deforestation; Protected area; Remote sensing","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Reforestation; Tropics; Bhutan; Conservation effectiveness; Forest conservation; Forest cover change; Geographical area; Protected areas; Satellite remote sensing; Topographical maps; Remote sensing; conservation management; database; deforestation; forest cover; land cover; protected area; remote sensing; satellite imagery; topographic mapping; afforestation; climate change; comparative effectiveness; data base; forest; land use; quantitative study; agriculture; angiosperm; biodiversity; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; gymnosperm; procedures; theoretical model; Himalayas; Agriculture; Angiosperms; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Gymnosperms; Models, Theoretical; Satellite Imagery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994504647"

Such modification has provoked the development of urban sprawl and massive land use replacement which poses serious threat to sustainable development. Consequently, numerous researches on urban growth and land use change have emerged from mostly developed countries. In cities of developing countries like Nigeria cities, there is limited understanding because of the few amount of studies in this topic, and most of which lack empirical groundwork. Hence, the need to conduct more quality researches arises in order to achieve significant understanding of the spatial pattern of land use transformation and dynamics of urban landscape. Such information would assist spatial planners to enact legislation pertaining to urban system, especially in cities of developing countries like Nigeria where empirical studies on this topic are limited and state-of-the-art tools for analyzing and measuring sprawl processes are lacking. Multi temporal remotely sensed data was utilized in this study in collaboration with GIS techniques, spatial metrics and indications. Landsat data of three temporal periods covering Benin metropolitan region were classified this revealed unprecedented and unique land use transition process were urban and forest lands have substantially replaced agricultural lands. As evident from the result of the study, substantial amount of agricultural communities mostly along the inter-state roads have become urbanized. The analysis shows that urban growth tend to double in size every 12 years with high magnitude of region-wise sprawl as shown by Shannon's entropy and such sprawl degree is largely influenced by the existing trunk roads. Zone-wise, metrics and Shannon's entropy revealed that Northeast and Southeast zones exhibit stronger sprawl tendency and have also turn out to be growth hotspot in the region. In addition, incremental spatial autocorrelation identified two distinct regime of urban expansion in the region, compaction regime covering 7 km radius from the centroid and edge expansion regime which exhibits dispersion with intermittent cluster peaks. This is supported by the result of landscape spatial metrics which indicates that urban land use aggregative force is more pronounced around the centroid and became more fragmented as built-up patches sprawl towards the city edge. The results show the effectiveness of integrating GIS methodology, spatial metrics and indicators to analyze spatiotemporal remote sensing data in order to assist urban planning and legislation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","GIS; Land use classification; Multi-temporal; Remote sensing; Shannon's entropy; Spatial metrics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84984817472"

The performance of the CA-MC and MLP-MC yielded more than 90% overall accuracy to predict the LULC, especially the MLP-MC method. Further, the annual population and economic growth rates were considered to produce the land demand for the LULC in 2014 and 2035 using the statistical extrapolation and system dynamics (SD). It was evident that the simulated map in 2014 resulting from the SD yielded the highest accuracy. Therefore, this study applied the SD method to generate the land demand for simulating LULC in 2035.

This paper integrates socioeconomic drivers, topographic variables, and policy guidance to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion between 1980 and 2013 in the Zhoushan islands, China. Our results indicate that the Zhoushan islands experienced remarkable urban expansion and economic prosperity over that period, with a clear acceleration since 2000. The increase in built initially occurred in urban cores and then spread to peri-ocean areas over the last decade. These hotspots were the outcomes of co-occurrence of ports, harbors, and coastal industries or tourism establishments, suggesting a considerable disparity among islands with different functions. We further quantified the socioeconomic drivers of urban expansion using multivariable regression. Generally, the major drivers were secondary and tertiary industry growth because of the effect of governmental interventions and changing economic conditions on coastal industries and tourism development. Cross-sea bridges also served to accelerate island development, while population had a lesser impact. Compared with other successful cases worldwide, extensive development and inefficient land use are prevalent in the Zhoushan islands. Available land has become more rare on the islands and reclamation from the ocean has been increasingly applied to expand land area for construction. There are still large gaps in island sustainable development, suggesting that intensive and reasonable land-use planning should be prioritized over exploring the potential for urban development. The results of this study can inform ecological management, and provide a scientific case for urban development and contributed to sustainability of islands and coastal regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Government policy; Island sustainability; Long historical; Remote sensing; Urban growth pattern","developing world; economic conditions; government; hot spot; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; sustainable development; urban development; urban policy; urbanization; China; Zhejiang; Zhoushan Island; Zhoushan Islands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949191833"

The study was undertaken in Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia. Ground-based data and high resolution images were used as reference data in LULC classification. To more accurately quantify landscape patterns and their changes, we applied new locally optimized separability enhancement indices and decision rules (SEI-DR approach) to address commonly observed classification accuracy problems in urban environments. We tested the SEI-DR approach using eight Landsat images acquired between 1985 and 2010. Two approaches were applied to quantify surface heat intensity (SHIn) and to examine its spatial patterns over 25 years: thermal gradient analysis and hot spot analysis. A Simultaneous Autoregressive Spatial error model (SARerr) was used to explore relationships between surface temperature and biophysical variables describing urban surfaces. Compared to Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, accuracy improvement achieved through use of the SEI-DR procedure was, respectively, 6% and 5% and the differences were statistically significant (P<. 0.05). The Surface Heat Intensity (SHIn) analysis showed increasing contrast (1985-2010) between urban centers and the outskirt. On average, outskirts were cooler than central urban areas by up to 3.7. °C. We detected statistically significant differences in intra-urban thermal aggregation (P<. 0.01) and the differences ranged from 4.4. °C to 5.3. °C. Increasing heat intensity was observed between 1985 and 2010. However, we observed no clear evidence of urban areas being warmer than rural. Built-up surfaces and bare soil showed similar positive relationships with surface temperature (P<. 0.01), while vegetation showed a negative relationship (P<. 0.05). We conclude that with rapid urbanization, thermal intensity increased but relationships with vegetation suggest that options for mitigating urban warming in tropical climates may be available.

The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km2 (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920-1975, 1975-1985, 1985-1995, 1995-2005 and 2005-2013. The grid cells of 1 km2 have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920-1975, 0.13 during 1975-1985, 0.12 during 1985-1995 and 0.01 during 1995-2005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km2 (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920’s to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km2 (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Conservation; Deforestation; Forest type; Fragmentation; Remote sensing; Western ghats","biodiversity; conservation; deforestation; forest cover; habitat fragmentation; land use change; long-term change; remote sensing; India; Western Ghats","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957699103"

In the present investigation, a GIS guided habitat search, using Lentinula edodes as a representative species, was used in mapping the habitats of wild edible macrofungi of the study region. Sampling of around 4 000 specimens per distinct morphological type available in the traditional markets and “sacred grove” forests indicated presence of ten common genera, belonging to nine different families of wild edible mushrooms. Nutritional profiling of the representative species Lentinula edodes was carried out by evaluation of its moisture, total fat, crude protein and carbohydrates contents by standard methods. Similarly, bioactive components determination was performed by estimation of total phenols, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, β-carotene and lycopenes. Bioactivity of the mushrooms extracts was studied using the DPPH radical scavenging and Human Red Blood Cell (HRBC) membrane stabilization assays. The present investigation successfully attempted to explore remote sensing technologies and GIS (Geographic Information System) based system to predict the natural habitats of wild edible mushrooms of Meghalaya, India which we believe will lead to the generation of a mushroom specific non-wood forest resource mapping system in the near future.

The Changhua watershed is a center of endemism for plants and birds and the cradle of Hainan’s main rivers. However, this area has experienced recent and ongoing deforestation and habitat fragmentation. To quantify habitat loss and fragmentation of natural forests, as well as the land-cover changes in the Changhua watershed, we analyzed Landsat images obtained in 1988, 1995, and 2005. Land-cover dynamics analysis showed that natural forests increased in area (97,909 to 104,023 ha) from 1988 to 1995 but decreased rapidly to 76,306 ha over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily throughout the study period while pulp plantations rapidly expanded after 1995. Similar patterns of land cover change were observed in protected areas, indicating a lack of enforcement. Natural forests conversion to rubber and pulp plantations has a general negative effect on biodiversity, primarily through habitat fragmentation. The fragmentation analysis showed that natural forests area was reduced and patch number increased, while patch size and connectivity decreased. These land-cover changes threatened local biodiversity, especially island endemic species. Both natural forests losses and fragmentation should be stopped by strict enforcement to prevent further damage. Preserving the remaining natural forests and enforcing the status of protected areas should be a management priority to maximize the watershed’s biodiversity conservation value. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biodiversity; Connectivity; Deforestation; Fragmentation; Plantation forest","Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Landforms; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Watersheds; Biodiversity conservation; Connectivity; Dynamics analysis; Fragmentation; Fragmentation analysis; Habitat fragmentation; Land-cover change; Plantation forests; Environmental protection; biodiversity; conservation management; deforestation; endemic species; forest management; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; land cover; plantation forestry; watershed; Article; biotransformation; China; conservation biology; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; forest fragmentation; Hevea brasiliensis; land use; nonhuman; plantation; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; procedures; tree; trends; Forests; Plantations; Changhua; Hainan; Taiwan; Aves; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Trees","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957410708"

Iran, as a developing country, is also experiencing growth of its urban areas during the last decades by high rate of rural–urban migration along with rapid socio-economic and political changes that has resulted in degrading environmental quality in many parts of Iran, particularly in the metropolitan areas such as Isfahan. Therefore, developing methods for assessing different urban growth planning scenarios and simulating urban expansion is critically important. The main goal of this study was simulating future urban expansion of Isfahan Metropolitan area from 2010 to 2050, by making use of cellular automata methodology in the SLEUTH modelling. The model was calibrated using historical data extracted from a time series of satellite images. The input data required by the model including Slope, Land use, Exclusion, Urban extent, Transportation and Hillshade were obtained from satellite images based on supervised classification. This research used the four images of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) acquired 1976, 1990, 2001, and 2010. Two scenarios were planned to simulate the spatial pattern of urban growth. The first scenario was historical urban growth, which permitted urban development maintenance of the historical trend and the second scenario was a more compact growth as an answer to hypothetical policies and the lack of land to decrease urban spreading. Calibration of the SLEUTH model for Isfahan metropolitan area showed a high spread coefficient, which means that the predicted mode of growth in Isfahan is “organic” or edge growth. In Isfahan metropolitan area, topography was also shown to have an enormous effect in controlling the urban development. The results of this study invites many opportunities for further studies in many other regions which are experiencing growth of their urban areas and can be useful for planners, and policy makers to implement preventative or controlling factors in advance and make more informed strategic decisions. © 2014, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Isfahan; Land use; Simulation; SLEUTH; Urban growth","calibration; growth modeling; land use; Landsat multispectral scanner; Landsat thematic mapper; metropolitan area; policy making; rural-urban migration; satellite imagery; urban development; urban growth; Esfahan [Esfahan (PRV)]; Esfahan [Iran]; Iran","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929706615"

Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km2) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity. The framework is broad enough to be applied to other study sites. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biodiversity hotspot; Chile; Deforestation; Plantation forestry; Remote sensing; Spatially-explicit prediction","Conservation; Deforestation; Developing countries; Forestry; Land use; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Timber; Biodiversity conservation; Chile; Environmental variables; Hot spot; Plantation forestry; Remote sensing techniques; Spatially explicit; Spatially-explicit modelling; Biodiversity; biodiversity; deforestation; land use change; modeling; plant; plantation forestry; prediction; remote sensing; spatial analysis; conservation biology; developing country; forest; land use; landscape; plant model; plantation; classification; environmental monitoring; forestry; procedures; tree; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Remote Sensing Technology; Trees","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987909730"

While the land use/cover change has accelerated land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change in the region, few studies exist on the drivers and implications of land use/cover dynamics in the basin. The study quantified the historical land use/cover changes beginning from 1984 to 2011 and predicted future changes using multi-level data-sets. We also examined population growth and government policies as they relate to land cover/use change. Data-sets from disparate sources consisting of multi-temporal satellite images, digital elevation model, population, and relevant ancillary data were used in the study. A combination of post-classification change detection method, intensity analysis, and Markov chain models were used to analyze and evaluate historical land use/cover changes and predict future change scenarios. We observed a major expansion of agriculture land at the loss of woodland savanna. Overall, change is more pronounced and fast during the period 1984-1994 and relatively slow during 1994-2011. Category and transition intensities were more pronounced in 1984-1994 than 1994-2011. These changes suggest policy intervention from government and individual response during the period 1994-2011. In addition, the study identified population growth, settlement expansion, and local policies as key drivers of land use/cover change. Future scenarios indicate: (1) increase in agriculture land use, (2) loss in woodland savanna and forest cover, and (3) significant wetland loss to agriculture. © 2014 The African Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers.","Kagera basin; land use/land cover; remote sensing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942363581"

Spatio-temporal patterns of change covering 1982-2011 are discussed in the context of changes in land use and land cover (LULCC). Location: Global. Methods: This study takes advantage of the different phenological cycles of recurrent vegetation (herbaceous vegetation) and persistent vegetation (woody/shrub cover) in combining trend analyses of global-scale vegetation based on different annual/seasonal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics. Spatial patterns of combined vegetation trends derived from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI are analysed using land-cover information (GLC2000). Results: The direction of change in annual and seasonal NDVI metrics is similar for most global terrestrial ecosystems, but areas of diverging trends were also observed for certain regions across the globe. These areas are shown to be dominated by land-cover classes of deciduous forest in tropical/subtropical areas. Areas of observed change are found in dry deciduous forest in South America and central southern Africa and are in accordance with studies of hotspot LULCC areas conducted at local and regional scales. The results show that dense time series of EO data can be used to map large-scale changes in ecosystem functional type that are due to forest cover dynamics, including forest degradation, deforestation/reforestation and bush encroachment. Main conclusions: We show that areas characterized by changes in ecosystem functioning governed by LULCC at regional and global scales can be mapped from dense time series of global EO data. The patterns of diverging NDVI metric trends can be used as a reference in evaluating the impacts of environmental changes related to LULCC and the approach may be used to detect changes in ecosystem functioning over time. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Ecosystem functioning change; Land-use land-cover change (LULCC); Phenology; Remote sensing; Trend analysis; Vegetation greenness","ecosystem function; global change; land cover; land use change; mapping; NDVI; observational method; phenology; remote sensing; terrestrial ecosystem; trend analysis; vegetation dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938958049"

We use the models to analyze deforestation patterns in Indonesia and the effectiveness of protected areas. Cross-validation indicated that models had an accuracy of 70-85%. We find that the spatial pattern of deforestation is explained by transport cost, agricultural rent and history of nearby illegal logging. The effectiveness of protected areas presented mixed results. After controlling for multiple confounders, protected areas of category Ia, exclusively managed for biodiversity conservation, were shown to be ineffective at slowing down deforestation. Our results suggest that monitoring and prevention of road construction within protected areas, using logging concessions as buffers of protected areas and geographical prioritization of control measures in illegal logging hotspots would be more effective for conservation than reliance on protected areas alone, especially under food price increasing scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation planning; Food security; Landscape modeling; Markov chain monte carlo; Spatial autoregressive models; Von thünen model","Bayesian analysis; biodiversity; conservation planning; deforestation; food security; land use change; land use planning; protected area; remote sensing; spatial analysis; Indonesia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928785089"

Determining the most frequently used migration routes and nonbreeding regions for a species is critical for understanding population dynamics and making effective conservation decisions. We tracked the migration of individual Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) (n = 102) from across their range with light-level geolocators and, for the first time, quantified migration routes and wintering regions for distinct breeding populations. We identified regional and species-level migratory connectivity networks for this declining songbird by combining our tracking results with range-wide breeding abundance estimates and forest cover data. More than 50% of the species occupied the eastern wintering range (Honduras to Costa Rica), a region that includes only one-third of all wintering habitat and that is undergoing intensive deforestation. We estimated that half of all Wood Thrushes in North America migrate south through Florida in fall, whereas in spring approximately 73% funnel northward through a narrow span along the central U.S. Gulf Coast (88-93°W). Identifying migratory networks is a critical step for conservation of songbirds and we demonstrated with Wood Thrushes how it can highlight conservation hotspots for regional populations and species as a whole. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Central America; Geolocator; Hylocichla mustelina; Migration network; Migration route; Migratory connectivity; Tropical deforestation","Animalia; Hylocichla; Hylocichla mustelina; Passeri; animal; animal behavior; animal dispersal; Central America; environmental protection; female; male; North America; physiology; population dynamics; population migration; remote sensing; season; songbird; Animal Distribution; Animal Migration; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Female; Homing Behavior; Male; Population Dynamics; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Songbirds","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921439641"

It is mainly driven by unorganized expansion, increased immigration, rapidly increasing population. In this context, land use and land cover change are considered one of the central components in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes. In Egypt, urban growth has brought serious losses of agricultural land and water bodies. Urban growth is responsible for a variety of urban environmental issues like decreased air quality, increased runoff and subsequent flooding, increased local temperature, deterioration of water quality, etc. Egypt possessed a number of fast growing cities. Mansoura and Talkha cities in Daqahlia governorate are expanding rapidly with varying growth rates and patterns. In this context, geospatial technologies and remote sensing methodology provide essential tools which can be applied in the analysis of land use change detection. This paper is an attempt to assess the land use change detection by using GIS in Mansoura and Talkha from 1985 to 2010.

Because of the conversion of mangrove forests to agricultural lands, the dramatic decline of mangrove forests in Irrawaddy Delta, South Myanmar during the past 30 years has been noticed and caused environment impacts, including habitat loss, reduction of biodiversity, and the increase of coastal erosion. This study firstly aims to investigate the changes of mangrove forests over the region of Irrawaddy Delta, using Landsat imageries during the periods of 1989 to 2014. Second, by a land cover modeling tool, Probabilistic Landscape Simulation (ProLAMS), is applied for predicting the future change of mangrove forests over the region. Specifically, ProLAMS adopts logistic regression analysis and cellular automata to assess the likelihood of future mangrove forest distribution. Different from other ecological models that mainly focuses on the mangrove decline, ProLAMS considers the increase pattern and decrease pattern at the same time to reflect the heterogeneous change of mangrove forest dynamics. Two major findings are: (1) from 1989 to 2014, both increase and decrease of mangrove forests are found in different parts of study area, but area of decrease is more significant than increase, showing about 26.7% decline of mangrove area within the period; (2) based on the model prediction, 16.8% decline of mangrove area from 2014 to 2030 is predicted. In sum, this study suggests that satellite imagery and the proposed model can provide the prediction of future scenarios for mangrove forests. We expect this approach can be useful and applicable for other regions to assist ecosystem conservation activity.","Change detection; Irrawaddy delta; Landsat imagery; Mangrove forest; ProLAMS","Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Change detection; Irrawaddy delta; Landsat imagery; Mangrove forest; ProLAMS; Forestry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964055219"

In order to improve our understanding of dynamic land systems, we employed the intermediate spatial resolution with high temporal resolution (16-day composite period) of MODIS 250 m Vegetation Index (VI) datasets. The smoothed MODIS-EVI Products over13 years (2001-2013) period in Jambi Province were analyzed and further validated by relevant Landsat Images and also ground checking and interviews with local people. The results were then compared with hotspot data derived from Aqua and Terra satellites with confidence level over 99 per cent. Other data such as provincial land use planning, concession areas and other type of land use zones are analyzed to look for any relationship. This study finds that the majority of land cover changes in Jambi have occurred mainly in production forest areas which are dominated by oil palm plantation and industrial forest concessions. There was relationship between forest and land fires with the landscape changes in which both were occurred mainly in dry seasons. However, the landscape changes are not wholly related to deforestation and forest degradation. The vegetation index could also drops significantly when companies replaced the old trees with new plants, or when it harvested for timber industries. In addition, some forest fire events were seen more frequent in secondary growth and abandoned peat land areas. It could be the case that the fire is still being used as tools by local communities or small farm holders in land preparation for agriculture purposes.","Enhanced vegetation Indices (EVI); Land Use Planning; Landscape dynamics; MODIS","Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forestry; Geomorphology; Land use; Palm oil; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Enhanced vegetation index; High temporal resolution; Land Use Planning; Landscape dynamics; Moderate resolution; MODIS; Multi-temporal analysis; Oil palm plantations; Vegetation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964039828"

To find sustainable land use options adapted to the local situation, a profound knowledge of the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of land cover change and its drivers is necessary, but hitherto lacking. The complex topography and the high cloud frequency make the use of remote sensing in this area a challenge. To deal with these conditions, we pursued specific pre-processing steps before classifying five Landsat scenes from 1975 to 2001. Then, we quantified land cover changes and habitat fragmentation, and we investigated landscape changes in relation to key spatial elements (altitude, slope, and distance from roads). Good classification results were obtained with overall accuracies ranging from 94.5% to 98.5% and Kappa statistics between 0.75 and 0.98. Forest was strongly fragmented due to the rapid expansion of the arable frontier and the even more rapid invasion by bracken. Unexpectedly, more bracken-infested areas were converted to pastures than vice versa, a practice that could alleviate pressure on forests if promoted. Road proximity was the most important spatial element determining forest loss, while for bracken the altitudinal range conditioned the degree of invasion in deforested areas. The annual deforestation rate changed notably between periods: ~1.5% from 1975 to 1987, ~0.8% from 1987 to 2000, and finally a very high rate of ~7.5% between 2000 and 2001. We explained these inconstant rates through some specific interrelated local and national political and socioeconomic drivers, namely land use policies, credit and tenure incentives, demography, and in particular, a severe national economic and bank crisis. © 2015 by the authors.","Andes; Attractors of landscape change; Bracken fern; Deforestation drivers; Ecuador; Fragmentation; Image pre-processing; Land cover change; Landsat; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Economics; Ecosystems; Geomorphology; Land use; Remote sensing; Andes; Bracken ferns; Ecuador; Fragmentation; Image preprocessing; Land-cover change; LANDSAT; Landscape changes; Forestry; Image Analysis; Land Use; Remote Sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926352511"

Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R2 = 0.56 to 0.78. We identified three hotspots in SE Asia with a total area of 156,000 km2, and found Myanmar to have more remaining DDF than the countries in SE Asia. Our approach proved to be a reliable method for mapping DDF and other seasonally influenced ecosystems on continental and regional scales, and is very valuable for conservation management in this region. © Christian Wohlfart, Martin Wegmann and Peter Leimgruber.","Fractional cover; MODIS NDVI; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Tropical dry forest conservation; Vegetation phenology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924756782"

Specifically, we assess whether it can (1) differentiate forest from non-forest and (2) detect forest degradation. The VCF percent tree cover layer is considered accurate if the percent tree cover value of forest is markedly higher than non-forest, and the value of conserved forest higher than degraded forest. Our results show that VCF percent tree cover can accurately differentiate forest from non-forest except from the case of tropical dry forest. It also discriminate primary forest from open secondary forest; however, secondary forest with regrowth shows higher percent tree cover value than primary forest. Based on the obtained results, the VCF percent tree cover seems to be a promising product for deforestation and degradation detection. However, a quantitative assessment incorporating other areas with more vegetation types is recommended before its application for forest cover change analysis in Mexico. © 2014 IEEE.","deforestation; forest degradation; MODIS vegetation continuous fields; percent tree cover; temperate forest; tropical dry forest","Deforestation; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Forest degradation; Temperate forests; Tree cover; Tropical dry forest; Vegetation continuous fields; Vegetation; Forests; Plants; Tropical Atmospheres","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84912113897"

The majority of these agricultural lands are converted to urban areas, which affects the ecosystems. In this research, an integrated model of Markov chain and cellular automata models was applied to simulate urban land use changes and to predict their spatial patterns in Tripoli metropolitan area, Libya. It is worth mentioning that there is not much research has been done about land use/cover change in Libyan cities. In this study, the performance of integrated CA–Markov model was assessed. Firstly, the Markov chain model was used to simulate and predict the land use change quantitatively; then, the CA model was applied to simulate the dynamic spatial patterns of changes explicitly. The urban land use change from 1984 to 2010 was modelled using the CA–Markov model for calibration to compute optimal transition rules and to predict future land use change. In validation process, the model was validated using Kappa index statistics which resulted in overall accuracy more than 85 %. Finally, based on transition rules and transition area matrix produced from calibration process, the future land use changes of 2020 and 2025 were predicted and mapped. The findings of this research showed reasonably good performance of employed model. The model results demonstrate that the study area is growing very rapidly especially in the recent decade. Furthermore, this rapid urban expansion results in remarkable continuous decrease of agriculture lands. © 2013, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Cellular automata; GIS; Land use change; Markov chain; Remote sensing; Tripoli, Libya","automation; calibration; GIS; land use change; mapping; Markov chain; metropolitan area; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Tripoli","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907232745"

Biodiversity conservation planning and accurate estimation of forest carbon fluxes and pools need more accurate information about forest area, spatial distribution and fragmentation. However, the recent forest maps of Southeast Asia were generated from optical images at spatial resolutions of several hundreds of meters, and they do not capture well the exceptionally complex and dynamic environments in Southeast Asia. The forest area estimates from those maps vary substantially, ranging from 1.73x106 km2 (GlobCover) to 2.69x106 km2 (MCD12Q1) in 2009; and their uncertainty is constrained by frequent cloud cover and coarse spatial resolution. Recently, cloud-free imagery from the Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) became available. We used the PALSAR 50-m orthorectified mosaic imagery in 2009 to generate a forest cover map of Southeast Asia at 50-m spatial resolution. The validation, using ground-reference data collected from the Geo-Referenced Field Photo Library and high-resolution images in Google Earth, showed that our forest map has a reasonably high accuracy (producer's accuracy 86% and user's accuracy 93%). The PALSAR-based forest area estimates in 2009 are significantly correlated with those from GlobCover and MCD12Q1 at national and subnational scales but differ in some regions at the pixel scale due to different spatial resolutions, forest definitions, and algorithms. The resultant 50-m forest map was used to quantify forest fragmentation and it revealed substantial details of forest fragmentation. This new 50-m map of tropical forests could serve as a baseline map for forest resource inventory, deforestation monitoring, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) implementation, and biodiversity. © 2014 Dong et al.","","accuracy; article; Asia; controlled study; forest fragmentation; geographic mapping; intermethod comparison; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; tropical rain forest; algorithm; biodiversity; biomass; crop; environmental protection; forest; geographic information system; geography; growth, development and aging; procedures; reproducibility; Southeast Asia; statistics and numerical data; telecommunication; theoretical model; tropic climate; Algorithms; Asia, Southeastern; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Forests; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Radar; Remote Sensing Technology; Reproducibility of Results; Tropical Climate","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899884487"

Land Use and Land Cover maps for the study area were derived from 1992, 2006, and 2012 Landsat satellite images (TM, ETM+). The models achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 80 %. A Markov model was applied for 2006 and 2012 to predict land cover in 2030. The results conformed to the general trend of the Al Ain Master Plan 2030. This study demonstrates that remote sensing, with the availability of free Landsat data, is a viable technology that could be used to help in the prediction process especially in developing countries, where data availability is a problem. © 2014 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Al Ain; Land change; Markov and cellular automata models; UAE","developing world; economic growth; land cover; numerical model; policy making; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; urban development; urban economy; Abu Dhabi [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893179012"

Borneo is the centre of diversity for the dipterocarps. Identification of hotspots is important for forest and biodiversity conservation efforts. Species Occurrence Models (SOMs) were generated for all 247 species of dipterocarps recorded in Sarawak using herbarium occurrence data and based on the best model selected. The species occurrence density map for each genus and category (endemic and non endemic) was generated by overlaying the SOMs of all species in each genus or category. The species occurrence density maps were analyzed with land cover map from Landsat 7-EMT+ images and protected forest areas for identifying hotspots for conservation in Sarawak. Overlaying the SOM maps revealed that areas in central Sarawak and the southwest region (northwest Borneo around Kuching) are the main hotspots of dipterocarp diversity in Sarawak while the coastal lowland areas in the lower Rejang and Baram River which are mainly peat swamp forest are poorer in species occurrence density. In terms of endemism, as with dipterocarp diversity, the mixed diptercarp forest of central Sarawak is also the most important hotspot. Gap analysis revealed that most protected forest areas are in southwest Sarawak (Bako, Kubah, Tanjung Datu and Gunung Gading National Parks) and in the northern part of Sarawak (Niah, Lambir Hills and Mt Mulu National Parks). This leaves the hotspot in the central part of Sarawak least protected.

Over the years, many urban growth models have been developed and used in the developed countries for forecasting growth patterns. In the developing countries however, there exist a very few studies showing the application of these models and their performances. In this study two models such as cellular automata (CA) and the SLEUTH models are applied in a geographical information system (GIS) to simulate and predict the urban growth and land use change for the City of Sana'a (Yemen) for the period 2004-2020. GIS based maps were generated for the urban growth pattern of the city which was further analyzed using geo-statistical techniques. During the models calibration process, a total of 35 years of time series dataset such as historical topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite imageries was used to identify the parameters that influenced the urban growth. The validation result showed an overall accuracy of 99.6 %; with the producer's accuracy of 83.3 % and the user's accuracy 83.6 %. The SLEUTH model used the best fit growth rule parameters during the calibration to forecasting future urban growth pattern and generated various probability maps in which the individual grid cells are urbanized assuming unique ""urban growth signatures"". The models generated future urban growth pattern and land use changes from the period 2004-2020. Both models proved effective in forecasting growth pattern that will be useful in planning and decision making. In comparison, the CA model growth pattern showed high density development, in which growth edges were filled and clusters were merged together to form a compact built-up area wherein less agricultural lands were included. On the contrary, the SLEUTH model growth pattern showed more urban sprawl and low-density development that included substantial areas of agricultural lands. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cellular automata; GIS; Land-use change; Remote sensing; Sana'a; SLEUTH; Urban growth","High-density development; Impact on the environment; Land-use change; Metropolitan cities; Models calibrations; Sana'a; SLEUTH; Urban growth patterns; Agriculture; Cellular automata; Developing countries; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Growth rate; Land use; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Urban growth; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; calibration; cellular automaton; decision making; developing world; geostatistics; GIS; growth modeling; land use change; model validation; remote sensing; time series; urban growth; urbanization; Amanah al Asmah; Sanaa; Yemen","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881662834"

After removing these climate induced influences, a significant decreasing trend still persists in the VOD residuals across regions of Mongolia.

We also collected information on the population of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, one of the world's most recognized flagship species for conservation) in the FNNP, socio-economic circumstances, and local farmers' attitudes and perceptions. The results showed that the conservation projects had effectively protected the existing forests, facilitated vegetation recovery and economic development, and meanwhile the giant panda population in the FNNP had considerably increased. Farmers living in zones with varying human disturbance intensities generally showed similarly positive attitudes towards the GGP. In the slightly- and moderately-disturbed zones, most farmers showed positive perceptions to environmental changes after the GGP, but the perceptions of most farmers in the intensely-disturbed zone were negative.

Riau Province located in central Sumatra is selected as a study area. Time series land cover maps were prepared for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 using 25 meters PALSAR mosaic data. Image segmentation technique was used for the mapping. We used Markov Chain, Bayesian, and fuzzy approaches to calibrate and validate a spatial model and predict the future landscape spatial patterns. We found that a large part of the forest was deforested in the past. Using the model, business as usual, regrowth and two governance scenarios were examined for the next two decades. The future spatial patterns of the deforestation between the scenarios are apparent. If the historical trend continues, the forest cover will be consistently disappeared leaving very few small forest patches by 2030. The deforestation pattern extends over adjacent and environmentally sensitive areas such as conservation forest in the peat swamp areas in the north-eastern part and dry-land areas in the south-western parts in the province. However, one of the governance scenarios has produced a balanced forest spatial pattern in the province as compared to the other scenarios. If this scenario is implemented fairly, most of the sub- regions will likely have a considerable amount of forest cover by the end of 2030.

The forest cover types and their distribution in the study area are governed by climatic conditions and topographical features, which change along the gradient from tropical in the south to alpine in the Greater Himalayas in the north. Arunachal Pradesh is part of the Himalayan Biodiversity Hotspot and is at the tri-junction of Indian, Sino-Japanese, and Indo-Malayan floristic regions. The evergreen forests in the area represent climatic climaxes, which are partly original virgin and partly affected by anthropogenic pressures. Due to phenological and physiognomic similarities in ecotone regions, the differences in the spectral reflectance between adjacent forest types are not well pronounced. The age of the forests, terrain characteristics, and the nature of the vegetation itself could be other reasons for the near-similar reflectance. It is for these reasons that conventional classification algorithms for supervised and unsupervised classification do not perform well. Therefore, there is a need to find a suitable method for vegetation and land-use mapping with high mapping accuracy in this region, which is a biodiversity hotspot. A suitable classification technique is important to characterize vegetation-cover type in this complex terrain. We tested unsupervised, supervised, hybrid, object-oriented, and expert classification techniques for vegetation and land-use mapping on Indian Remote Sensing (IRS)-1C LISS III data. The expert classifier produced the highest accuracy (93.39%) followed by object-oriented, hybrid, and supervised and unsupervised classification techniques. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","Algorithms; Biodiversity; Image classification; Land use; Landforms; Mapping; Phenols; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Anthropogenic pressures; Classification algorithm; Classification technique; Climatic conditions; Complex terrains; Digital image; Evergreen forests; Forest cover; Forest type; Hilly terrains; Himalayas; Hot spot; Land-use mappings; Landuse classifications; Linear imaging; LISS-III; Mapping accuracy; Object oriented; Sensor data; Spectral reflectances; Study areas; Supervised and unsupervised classification; Terrain characteristics; Topographical features; Forestry; algorithm; digital image; evergreen forest; forest cover; image classification; IRS (satellite); land use; LISS; terrain; unsupervised classification; vegetation cover; Classification; Himalaya; Image Analysis; India; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Arunachal Pradesh","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874632230"

Monitoring studies or even surveys of species and community diversity in changing landscapes or disturbed areas require an assessment of the land cover changes over time. Here, we present a method combining remote sensing and structural equation models (SEM) to describe and analyse landscape dynamics. We focus on the mount Oku as an example, which is a mountain area located in north-west Cameroon. This site hosts the largest remaining tract of Central African cloud forest, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by contemporary land-use changes. Our aim is to characterize land cover changes over the last three decades and to quantify and elucidate the causes of deforestation and forest fragmentation. For this purpose, we integrate several Landsat satellite images taken between 1978 and 2007 in a Geographic Information System (GIS), and compare changes in land-use types. We assess forest fragmentation over this period by comparing the number, the area and the perimeter of forest fragments, and derive a forest fragmentation index. Finally, we quantify the respective effects of natural (altitude, slope) and human (human density, distance to villages) factors on deforestation using SEM. We evidence two periods in the dynamics of the cloud forest cover: a period of intense deforestation (1978-2001), followed by a period of re-afforestation (2001-2007). The forest cover lost 62.1% of its area (12,060 ha) between 1978 and 2001, corresponding to an averaged deforestation rate of 579 ha.yr-1. Deforested areas were mainly converted into crop lands (+75.6% between 1978 and 1988), under the pressure of an increasing human density, which was multiplied by 20 between 1921 and 2005 and doubled during the last 18 years. After 2001, the forest cover stabilized with the appearance of numerous small fragments of secondary forest, reflecting the success of the local biodiversity protection programs. Despite this recent progression of the forest cover, the proportion of ancient forest has continuously decreased from 1978 to 2007, indicating that deforestation is still ongoing. In 2007, the forest cover was a mosaic composed of 66% of recent secondary forests (i.e. forests appeared after 1978) and only 34% of ancient forests (i.e. present before 1978). Between 1978 and 2007, the number of forest fragments increased from 2627 to 5183, their average area decreased from 7.4 to 1.8 ha, and perimeter from 912 to 446 m, and the forest fragmentation index increased by 285.7%. Deforestation started from lower altitudes (<2300 m, before 1988) and progressed towards higher altitudes (2100-2900 m) between 1988 and 2001. SEM showed that altitude and slope had a significant negative effect on human density, explaining why the deforestation has been low on steep slopes and/or at higher altitudes. Our study reveals that the last fragments of the primary cloud forest of mount Oku could be definitively lost in the next decades. As tropical primary forests are irreplaceable ecosystems that host numerous endemic species, we recommend (1) to urgently protect the last remnants of ancient forest for their biological value; clear-cuts, grazing in forest interior and fires should be excluded from these areas, and (2) to extend secondary forests around ancient forest fragments so that they can act as a protective buffer and be managed as community forests and used for hunting and logging activities.

Understanding the effects of the change on biodiversity is important to reduce loss of biodiversity and mass extinction, and to insure the long-term persistence of natural resources and natures' services. Especially in remote landscapes of developing countries, precise knowledge about on-going processes is scarce. Here we apply satellite imagery to assess spatio-temporal land use and land cover change (LULCC) in the Bale Mountains for a period of four decades. This study aims to identify the main drivers of change in vegetation patterns and to discuss the implications of LULCC on spatial arrangements and trajectories of floral communities. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat MSS, Landsat ETM + and SPOT for four time steps (1973, 1987, 2000, and 2008) were analyzed using 11 LULC units defined based on the dominant plant taxa and cover types of the habitat. Change detection matrices revealed that over the last 40 years, the area has changed from a quite natural to a more cultural landscape. Within a representative subset of the study area (7,957.5 km-2), agricultural fields have increased from 1.71% to 9.34% of the total study area since 1973. Natural habitats such as upper montane forest, afroalpine grasslands, afromontane dwarf shrubs and herbaceous formations, and water bodies also increased. Conversely, afromontane grasslands have decreased in size by more than half (going from 19.3% to 8.77%). Closed Erica forest also shrank from 15.0% to 12.37%, and isolated Erica shrubs have decreased from 6.86% to 5.55%, and afroalpine dwarf shrubs and herbaceous formations reduced from 5.2% to 1.56%. Despite fluctuations the afromontane rainforest (Harenna forest), located south of the Bale Mountains, has remained relatively stable. In conclusion this study documents a rapid and ecosystemspecific change of this biodiversity hotspot due to intensified human activities (e.g., deforestation, agriculture, infrastructure expansion). Specifically, the ecotone between the afromontane and the afroalpine area represent a ""hotspot of biodiversity loss"" today. Taking into consideration the projections of regional climate warming and modified precipitation regimes, LULCC can be expected to become even more intensive in the near future. This is likely to impose unprecedented pressures on the largely endemic biota of the area. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Biodiversity loss; Elevational gradient; Endemism; Land use change; Remote sensing; Tropical mountains; Vegetation dynamics","Biodiversity loss; Elevational gradient; Endemism; Land-use change; Tropical mountains; Vegetation dynamics; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Deforestation; Developing countries; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Land use; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Landforms; biodiversity; climate change; community dynamics; endemism; flora; habitat type; human activity; land cover; land use change; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; satellite imagery; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; tropical environment; vegetation dynamics; agricultural land; article; climate; deforestation; ecosystem; environmental change; Ethiopia; fire; forest; geology; geomorphology; grassland; habitat use; image analysis; image processing; land use; landscape ecology; nonhuman; population density; population growth; rain forest; species endemicity; tropical mountain; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Plants; Urbanization; Developing Countries; Land Use; Mountains; Remote Sensing; Seasonal Variation; Tropical Atmospheres; Bale Mountains; Erica","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871712512"

We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300 m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10 % forest cover in protected areas. San Félix-San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500 km2, forest cover is less than 50 km2, and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions.

The exercise highlighted large-scale deforestation in the study area during 1975-1990 as well as 1990-2009 forest cover vectors. A net loss of 2,334.28 km2 forest cover was noticed between 1975 and 2009, and with current rate of deforestation, a forest area of 4,563.34 km2 will be lost by 2028. The annual rate of deforestation worked out to be 0.35 and 0.78% during 1975-1990 and 1990- 2009 respectively.

Problems such as high level of population increase, high level of resources consumption and population concentration in urban areas, make the achievement of sustainable future more difficult. Currently, more than 50% of population live in urban areas, and by 2020, this number will reach to 60%. The role of cities in achieving sustainable development is quite important, since large cities are the consumers of natural resources. In fact they are the producers of pollution sources, and the place of human activities concentration. Thus, urban management is an important issue. One of the controversial issues is urban sprawl. There are numerous definitions of urban sprawl. In summary, urban sprawl has been defined as unplanned sprawl, uncontrolled expansion, mono-functional land use, low density and discontinuous land use. Some of the consequences of urban sprawl are occupying green spaces around cities, high costs of infrastructure, high level of energy use, social segregation, car dependency, traffic increase, pollution, temperature increase and decrease in air and water quality. Materials and Methods The major goal of this paper is to examine the relationship between urban sprawl, measured by the pattern of concentration of urban facilities and utilities, and its environmental impacts on Tehran. This research is focused on examining the impact of Tehran's urban sprawl on four environmental variables: (1) Air pollution, (2) Temperature, (3) land cover vegetation and (4) sound pollution. The conceptual model of the research is built on these assumptions that the pattern of urban transportation and urban trips are the results of the urban facilities and urban services distribution, jobs and housing, and they affect the number, length and types of trips occurred within a city. Another assumption is that the pattern of transportation infrastructure and the availability of urban public transportation determine the degree of using private cars. Since urban facilities are concentrated in the central part of Tehran, while housing units are located in the outer layers of the city, urban sprawl and urban transportation are not adequately available and effective. Thus, private car dependency has increased. In recent years, Tehran has experienced urban sprawl. The current trend is towards more decentralization of population, longer trips and private car dependency, and the expansion of transportation infrastructure. Increase in the distance between home and working, shopping, and educational places, and lack of effective public transportation have increased the tendency for using private cars. One of the most important consequences is environmental problems, such as increase in air pollution, the amounts of impervious lands and sound pollution, and decrease in water quality and urban green spaces. This research examines the relationship between the pattern of urban facilities distribution and its impacts on environmental variables. Air pollution: Increase in the use of car can increase the level of carbon dioxide, particles, nitrogen, and hydrocarbon in the air, which can cause breathing, and other health problems. It can damage buildings, and aesthetic aspects of cities. It is assumed that accessibility to major urban services: educational, emergency, health, cultural and recreational facilities are the major causes of commuting. Study showed that these facilities are concentrated in the central parts of Tehran city. Distances with the urban facilities were measured for different regions in the city. Distance to different urban facilities (educational, emergency, health, cultural, recreational, and subway stations) were weighted. Accessibility to emergency facilities has the highest weight and educational facilities have the next highest weight. Accessibility to subway stations, recreational facilities, and cultural facilities have the third, equal weights and accessibility to health facilities has the fourth rank. The highest degree of accessibility to these facilities belongs to central regions of Tehran city. Accessibility to urban facilities decreases with distance from center. Moran index was also used to measure the pattern of distribution of urban facilities. Moran index shows that urban facilities are clustered in the central part of Tehran. Hotspot analysis was used to find the degree of variation of areas regarding the distance from urban facilities. This pattern of decreasing the availability of urban facilities with increasing the distance from center creates more frequent using of private cars, and as a result more air pollution. The results of study show that the highest degree of pollution exists in central areas of the city. The northern regions have least amount of air pollution, because of less commuting to these regions. Temperature: In hot days, urban areas are about 6 to 8 degrees warmer than the surrounding areas. This creates a situation called heat island. Heat islands are created because of two reasons: the dark color of asphalt on the roofs and roads which absorb more heat; and loss of land cover vegetation which usually has shadow and cools the weather. The distribution of high temperature points in the city shows that the southern and central parts of the city have temperatures higher than the average. The central parts of Tehran are destinations for commuting. Region 1 in North of Tehran has the lowest temperature.- Sound Pollution: The results of research show that noise causes changes in the physiologic system such as increasing blood pressure, loss of concentrating ability and loss of memory. To analyze the impacts of commuting on sound pollution, distances from highways, major roads, rails, and airport were used as indicators of pollution sources. Distances from highways, railroads and airport were weighted. The distances from airport have the highest weights. The distances from major highways stand in the second place. The study shows that the highest amounts of sound pollution occur in central, western and southern parts of the city and the least amounts of sound pollution are observed in North of Tehran. Land cover vegetation: Green spaces filter urban pollution, increase aesthetic aspects of city, increase underground waters, and are good habitats for natural wildlife. Green spaces also improve the quality of life. Results of previous studies show that green environment improves the physical and emotional conditions of individuals. Urban sprawl causes the fragmentation and loss of green spaces. Remote sensing data were used to analyze the distribution of green space in Tehran. Arc GIS was used to present the areal statistics for vegetation cover. The highest amount of vegetation is observed in the northern part of the city and the lowest amount is observed in the central part. Regression analysis was used to measure the association between the distance from CBD and environmental variables (air pollution, temperature, sound pollution, and land cover vegetation). The results show that there is a positive correlation between population density and accessibility to urban facilities (0.561).There is also a positive correlation between air pollution and accessibility to urban facilities. The result shows that there is a negative correlation between air pollution and vegetation. There is also a negative correlation between vegetation and temperature. Conclusion General concern about the impacts of urban sprawl on environmental, economic, and social variables has led to considering the urban land use pattern. Urban sprawl with high level of dispersion and shortage of resources in developing countries is one of the events that have received urban planner's attention. In this article, the pattern of distribution of urban facilities and their impacts on the environmental Variables (air pollution, land cover vegetation, sound pollution and temperature) were studied. The results of study show that Tehran has experienced urban sprawl in recent years. Urban sprawl has happened while there has been no plan for decentralization of urban services and urban services are concentrated in the central part of the city. Results of Moran Index and Geary Index show the significant concentration of urban facilities in the central parts of Tehran. High concentration of urban services in central parts of the city and lack of efficient urban transit system have caused high levels of private car dependency to reach to urban facilities. This has led to environmental impacts such as occupying green spaces, higher level of air pollution, higher temperature, and sound pollution. The results of this study show that this commuting has caused air pollution, increase in temperature, sound pollution and losing land cover vegetation in Tehran. Urban sprawl, increase of distance between home or work place and urban facilities has encouraged the use of private cars. Pearson analysis shows correlation between the distribution patterns of urban facilities and environmental variables. There is significant positive correlation between the accessibility to urban facilities and population density and air pollution. There is a significant negative correlation between land cover vegetation and accessibility to urban facilities. Investments in transportation infrastructure, promoting urban transportation, and well-planned distribution of urban services are recommended. According to the literature about urban sprawl cites, urban sprawl is not an urban pattern but an urban process and it matters to determine that at which phase of urban development Tehran is. Tehran like many other cities in developing countries is in the stage of urban growth and urban expansion. This process is inevitable. Considering the principles of smart growth and the application of them can be a good policy guide for urban and regional planners.","Accessibility; Air pollution; Land covers vegetation; Land surface temperature; Sound pollution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860194091"

We identify the main biofuel production hotspots in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. We find that this task is extremely difficult because of the following methodological challenges. First, biofuel production may have either direct or indirect impacts on deforestation, and indirect deforestation can take place at both national and international levels. Second, measuring both deforestation and biofuel production accurately is difficult due to the lack of standard definitions and the lack of updated data sets with sufficient spatial resolution and global coverage. Third, many feedstocks used for biofuel production are multipurpose since they are produced for both food and fodder and for fuels; thus decisions on how much feedstock is devoted to any of the uses vary considerably over time, depending on market prices. Assessing the share of biofuel in the deforestation caused by such multi–end use crops is difficult; there are several different ways to allocate this burden. Fourth, deforestation is often caused by multiple drivers, of which in any given area biofuels (or biofuel production) may be just one. This chapter reviews the methodological difficulties in estimating the relationship between biofuel and deforestation in detail and considers both the well-established biofuel feedstocks, such as sugarcane for ethanol (in Brazil and Argentina) and palm oil for diesel (in Malaysia and Indonesia), and the emergent feedstocks, such as jatropha, which is expanding in sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Latin America. © Cambridge University Press 2012.","Biofuel hotspot; Deforestation; Land use change; Remote sensing; Tropics","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924162703"

Urbanization has brought great challenges to the sustainable development of cities, especially in developing countries. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for the future health of the cities. The main goal of this study was to create a modeling system capable of depicting, quantitatively and graphically, the growth impacts of two land use policies and trends in the city of Kahramanmaras. Given its success with regional scale simulation, its ability to incorporate different levels of land protection through an ""excluded"" layer, and the relative ease of implementation and computation, the model developed by Keith Clarke from University of California at Santa Barbara, known as SLEUTH, was adopted for this study. SLEUTH is a pixel-based cellular automaton (CA) model and has been applied to several cities worldwide successfully. The model was calibrated using historic time series of developed areas derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery between 1984 and 2009, and future growth was projected out to 2040. Two alternative growth scenarios were modeled: (1) current trends, and (2) managed growth: regions with high landscape potential were protected from urbanization. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues and provides useful information for the cities' future planning and development. © 2012 Triveni Enterprises.","Future urban growth; Land use/land cover change; Remote sensing; SLEUTH","calibration; cellular automaton; developing world; future prospect; imagery; land use planning; landscape planning; numerical model; pixel; regional planning; remote sensing; sustainable development; thematic mapping; time series; urban development; urban growth; urbanization; Kahramanmaras; Turkey","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866562771"

It extends the land change record to 2008 using Chinese-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS)-2 and CBERS-2B data on a multi-scene level. It also establishes a methodology to correct for systematic distortion inherent in CBERS imagery without the loss of information present in Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery post-2003. Image analysis focuses on a 63 000 km2 strip of land along a main highway and railroad in southeastern Bolivia named the Corredor Bioceánico. This strip of land is one of the most important agriculturally driven deforestation hotspots in Latin America. It is also located in one of the most poorly understood forest biomes in the world in terms of LULCC - Southern Hemisphere seasonally dry tropical forests - which have very high conservation values globally. Over the 33-year study period, approximately 12 000 km2 of forest was lost among the three sub-regions - which is an area nearly the size of Connecticut. Evidence suggests that agriculture-driven deforestation is pushing into sensitive areas threatening globally important ecosystems such as those in the Chaco, Chiquitano and Pantanal as well as noteworthy protected areas. The results also show that imagery of CBERS-2 and CBERS-2B can help to fill the imagery gap created by Landsat ETM's Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in 2003.

The Changhua watershed is the cradle of Hainan's main river and a center of endemism for plants and birds. The watershed contains great habitat diversity and is an important conservation area. We analyzed the impact of rubber and pulp plantations on the distribution and area of tropical forest in the watershed, using remote sensing analysis of Landsat images from 1988, 1995 and 2005. From 1988 to 1995, natural forest increased in area (979-1040sqkm) but decreased rapidly (763sqkm) over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily through the study period while pulp plantations appeared after 1995 but occupied 152sqkm by 2005. Rubber and pulp plantations displace different types of natural forest and do not replace one another. Because pulp is not as profitable as rubber and existing pulp processing capacity greatly exceeds local supply, considerable pressure exists on remaining upland forests. We recommend for future management that these plantation forests be reclassified as 'industrial', making a clear policy distinction between natural and industrial forestry. Additionally, the local government should work to enforce existing laws preventing forest conversion on marginal and protected areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Eucalyptus; Government policy; Hevea; Industrial forest; Lowland deforestation; Protected area","Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental protection; Remote sensing; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Tropics; Watersheds; Changhua; Eucalypti; Hevea; Hotspots; Industrial forest; Lowland deforestation; Natural forests; Protected areas; Tropical forest; Tropical island; Deforestation; biodiversity; bird; deforestation; endemism; forestry policy; habitat conservation; hot spot; local government; protected area; remote sensing; rubber; shrub; tropical forest; upland region; article; Eucalyptus; plantation; tropical rain forest; watershed; China; Hainan; Aves","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-82255173841"

This urban sprawl is causes loss agricultural lands surrounding the city and environmental problems. For urban sprawl modeling in this paper using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and GIS analysis Tabriz expansion has been measured in the period 1972 to 2010. First, geometric correction and contrast stretch were applied. In order to urban sprawl detection, image differencing, principal component analyses and Fuzzy ARTMAP classification method were applied. Finally, the results of land use classification for 4 different times are compared to reveal urban sprawl. Then, combined Cellular Automata with Markov Chain analysis is employed to forecast urban sprawl until 2020 in Tabriz area. The result shows that Tabriz city area in 1972 was 1731 hectares that has been reached to 11854 hectares in 2010. Most of this sprawl has been occurred in range and agricultural land.

Relevant information on the transitional changes of forested landscapes in the delta is poor compared to other tropical forests such as the Brazilian and Columbian Amazonian forest where numerous research studies have been conducted. Consequently, this study aimed at investigating the spatial extent and rates of forest transition in the Niger Delta region taking into consideration the patterns, causes and implications of the landscape dynamics. The study determined the spatial extent and rates of forest transition in the study area using remotely sensed data from 1986 and 2007. The results indicated that the spatial extent of deforestation, unchanged forest cover and afforestation were 1.38, 2.39, and 1.15 million hectares, respectively, while the annual deforestation and afforestation rates were 0.95 and 0.75% which are high compared to other areas in the humid tropics. The annual rate of change in forest cover was determined as -0.13% indicating an overall reduction in the spatial extent of forest cover for the entire delta. Changes in the spatial structure of forests were investigated using landscape metrics and the results showed there was a substantial increase in forest fragmentation. The variations in population dynamics and poverty indicators between different states of the Niger Delta were unable to explain the observed patterns of forest change. Instead, the authors observed that the main determinants of forest dynamics were the variations in state forest management policies and the influence of the oil and gas industry on the economies of the states. High rates of afforestation were found in states that have limited oil resources and were more economically dependent on forest products, while states with high deforestation rates were found in the main oil-producing parts of the study site. Using the present trend of forest transition dynamics, a 20-year forward simulation was generated using the Markov algorithm. The results concerning forest transition in the study area point to the urgent need for appropriate environmental policy development and implementation for the Niger Delta region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Afforestation; Classification; Deforestation; Forest transition; Fragmentation; Markov; Niger Delta","Afforestation; Classification; Forest transition; Fragmentation; Markov; Niger Delta; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Gas industry; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum prospecting; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Dynamics; afforestation; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; deforestation; environmental policy; exploitation; forest cover; forest dynamics; forest ecosystem; forest management; forest resource; habitat fragmentation; hydrocarbon exploration; landscape change; logging (timber); Markov chain; policy development; population dynamics; poverty; stand structure; Crude Oil; Forestation; Gas; Nigeria; Remote Sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955846992"

Urbanization is a process of increase of modernization system which modifies the socioeconomic activities and revolutionizes the land use practice according to time frame. Due to the proximate and underlying causes, land use and land cover change has become the main challenge of the present world. Due to the huge course of urbanization, the major cities of the world are compelled to face the severe threats. Various causes of the urbanization process bring the unrestrained impact on land use and land cover change. An unplanned urbanization process is becoming the major problem in the developed and developing countries. Population growth, migration, political instability, economic opportunities, centralized plans and policies of the government, accessibility of physical infrastructure, globalization are some of the major causes of the high level of urbanization in Nepal. This paper presents the historical urban growth phenomenon and analysis of land use and land cover change of Pokhara sub-metropolitan by utilizing remote sensing imagery and GIS. In the study, Markov chain model has been used to predict future changes based on the rate of past change in IDRISI GIS. The landsat images of 1977 MSS, 1990 TM, 1999 ETM+ and 2010 TM are rectified and registered in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 44N. Supervised classification system has been used to classify the images of different land use categories. Six land use classes have been identified: Urban (Built-up), water body, open field, forest cover, cultivated land and sandy area. Urban land use change for the year 2021 was modeled using a Markov chain based approach. For the projection of 2021, transitional probability matrix table from the land use land cover map of 1999 and simulated map of 2010 is derived.

This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian approach; Cellular automata; Land cover change; LUCC; Urbanization; Weight of evidence","Bayesian approaches; Land-cover change; LUCC; Urbanization; Weight of evidence; Bayesian networks; Cellular automata; Developing countries; Extrapolation; Land use; Pattern recognition systems; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Time series; Landforms; Bayesian analysis; cellular automaton; complexity; developing world; land cover; land use; metropolitan area; remote sensing; urban area; urban development; urban economy; urban growth; urbanization; Bagmati; Kathmandu; Nepal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650205824"

Current methods aimed at the detection and monitoring of fire events in the Brazilian Amazon are frequently insufficient for policy decisions which aim to prevent new fire events and identify the previous land cover of the affected areas. This research applies remote sensing and GIS technique to areas with high occurrence of forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon, with the aiming to recognize land use changes that could: 1) Identify areas with high risk of being burnt and 2) Improve current fire scars mapping methods by enabling the discrimination of fires in primary forests and fires in previously burnt areas. The Change Vector Analysis method was applied to the Red and NIR bands of two MODIS/Terra images from key dates prior to the 2005 forest fire season, resulting in one change vector image with two components: direction and magnitude of changes. A Decision Tree (DT) was designed and evaluated through the C 4.5 algorithm to classify 2400 sample pixels extracted from four selected classes inside the change vector images: A) Forest; B) Agricultural areas; C) Fire risk in primary forest; and D) Fire risk in already degraded areas. The DT achieved a global accuracy of 90.21%. Samples from classes B and D were the main contributors to the DT confusion, with omission errors of 9.5% and 24.5%, respectively.

In this study, we use fuzzy set theory integrated with decision-making algorithm in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) framework to map forest fire risk. Fuzzy set theory implements classes or groupings of data with boundaries that are not sharply defined (i.e., fuzzy) and consists of a rule base, membership functions, and an inference procedure. We used satellite remote sensing datasets in conjunction with topographic, vegetation, climate, and socioeconomic datasets to infer the causative factors of fires. Spatial-level data on these biophysical and socioeconomic parameters have been aggregated at the district level and have been organized in a GIS framework. A participatory multicriteria decision-making approach involving Analytical Hierarchy Process has been designed to arrive at a decision matrix that identified the important causative factors of fires. These expert judgments were then integrated using spatial fuzzy decision-making algorithm to map the forest fire risk. Results from this study were quite useful in identifying potential ""hotspots"" of fire risk, where forest fire protection measures can be taken in advance.

In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of 0. 1 ha covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using Ward's method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes.

In this study, we analyzed all fire events in Borneo recorded by satellites over a period of 10 years. About 16.2 Mha, which corresponds to 21% of the land surface, have been affected by fire at least once and 6% more than one time. During El Niño conditions, which cause prolonged droughts in the region, the fire-affected area was on average three times larger than during normal weather conditions. Similarly, fires in forests affected 0.3 Mha in normal years and 1 Mha during El Niño years. Carbon rich peat swamp forest ecosystems were most severely affected. There is a pronounced difference in fire occurrence between different countries and provinces in Borneo although ecosystem and land use are very similar across the island. Compared with Sarawak, Sabah (Malaysia) and Brunei the relative annual fire-affected area in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, was on average five times larger. During El Niño conditions the fire-affected area increased only in Kalimantan and not in Brunei and the Malaysia. A similar pattern was observed in National Parks. This suggests, that El Niño related droughts are not the only cause of increased fire occurrence and do not necessarily lead to a higher number of fire events. These results improve our understanding of existing fire regimes and drivers of fire in SE Asian tropical ecosystems and may help to better protect the remaining rainforests. © 2008 Remote Sensing Solutions GmbH Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","ATSR; AVHRR; Borneo; Deforestation; Fire; Forest degradation; Hotspot; Indonesia; Malaysia; MODIS","AVHRR; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; deforestation; El Nino; forest ecosystem; hot spot; land surface; MODIS; rainforest; swamp forest; tropical forest; Asia; Borneo; Brunei Darussalam; East Malaysia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Malay Archipelago; Malaysia; Sarawak; Southeast Asia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-58149497029"

Despite its mathematical simplicity, this index has been shown to be sensitive to atmospheric conditions or acquisition geometry, not to mention its saturation for covers with high foliage density. The land surface temperature (LST) of the observed cover provides additional information as regards its ability to regulate its temperature and is generally less affected by atmospheric conditions when water vapor is taken into account. The work presented here uses the whole extent of the Pathfinder AVHRR Land database (1981-2001) to characterize trends in vegetation, by estimating NDVI and LST, which behavior is analyzed annually on a pixel by pixel basis using the YLCD method. Three parameters are extracted from this behavior, which are respectively related to land cover characteristics, to vegetation seasonality, and to the confidence in the linear model chosen for this analysis. The resulting time series have been tested for the influence of the orbital drift effect, and have been proved independent for most of the globe with moderate to high confidence levels (a > 0.80). Trends for these three parameters show a tendency to desertification for arid and semi-arid areas, and the previously documented greening trend of the northern hemisphere at mid-latitudes. Moreover, tropical areas which have been under persistent deforestation between 1981 and 2001 can be clearly identified, and correspond to known deforestation hotspots.","","Deforestation; Image analysis; Pixels; Remote sensing; Acquisition geometry; Arid and semi-arid areas; Atmospheric conditions; Land surface temperature; Normalized difference vegetation index; Northern Hemispheres; Remote sensing applications; Vegetation seasonality; Vegetation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037526667"

Current vegetation patterns were mapped using an IRS P6 LISS III image and this was used together with Landsat MSS data from 1973 to map land cover transitions. Two major and divergent trends were observed. A dominant degradational trend can be attributed to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development while a successional trend, resulting from protection of the area, showed the resilience of the system after prolonged disturbances. The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas. The study demonstrates that remotely sensed land cover assessments can have important contributions to monitoring land management strategies, understanding processes underpinning land use changes and helping to inform future conservation strategies. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Change assessment; Protected area management; Remote sensing; Tropical forest; Western ghats","Agricultural expansion; Biogeochemical cycle; Change assessment; Complex Processes; Conservation measures; Conservation strategies; Hot spot; Infrastructure development; Land cover; Land managements; Land-cover change; Land-use change; LANDSAT; Management regime; Protected area management; Radiation budget; Rapid changes; Tropical forest; Vegetation pattern; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Tropics; Environmental protection; biodiversity; conservation management; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; IRS (satellite); land cover; land management; Landsat multispectral scanner; LISS; mapping method; nature conservation; protected area; remote sensing; tropical forest; article; biogeochemical cycle; deforestation; environmental protection; India; land use; trend study; vegetation dynamics; wildlife conservation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Trees; Tropical Climate; Forest Management; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Western Ghats","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-72349087456"

Cells in the landscapes were modeled as vertices of dynamic graph automata that allow temporally variable causal connectivity between spatially nonadjacent cells. A trial was carried out to represent changes in an Amazonian and a tropical Andean landscape modeled as dynamic graph automata with input from a Landsat TM-derived Level 1 classification with the following classes: for the Amazon - forest, nonforest vegetation, water, and urban or bare (soil); for the Andes - forest, scrub (shrub or grassland), agriculture, and bare or exposed ground. Explicit automata transition rules were used to simulate temporal land-cover change. These rules were derived independently from fieldwork in each area, including vegetation plots or transects and informal interviews. Such a generalization of cellular automata was useful for modeling land-use-land-cover change (LULCC), although it potentially increases the computational complexity of an already data intensive process (involving 5 - 8 million cells, in 1000 stochastic simulations, with each simulation encompassing 15 annual time steps). The interannual predicted LULCC, while more nuanced in the Andean site, poses a serious threat to compositional and configurational stability in both the Andes and the Amazon, with implications for landscape heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","","cellular automaton; computer simulation; forest cover; grassland; habitat fragmentation; heterogeneity; image classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat thematic mapper; landscape change; modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; stochasticity; vegetation cover; Amazon River; Andes; South America","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-66349120118"

The satellite will be equipped with three optical sensors: a medium-high spatial resolution VIS-NIR multi-spectral sensor, allowing the surface monitoring and land-use and land-cover studies; a medium spatial-resolution 3-bands thermal (MIR-TIR) sensor allowing the surface temperature (LST, SST) estimate and hot-spots (fires, volcanic eruption, etc.) detection; a panchromatic VIS-NIR camera for night-time observation able to reveal artificial and natural lights. The selected orbit, called multi-sun-synchronous (MSS), represents an innovation with respect to the classical sun-synchronous orbit much suitable for observing tropical regions, allowing an enhanced revisit frequency. Further, such an orbit allows the observation of the same region of the Earth at different local-time.

This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900 ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.","Ecological; Forest fires; India; Spatial; Temporal; Tropics","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Calcium; Curing; Deforestation; Disasters; Drying; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Photoacoustic effect; Remote sensing; Space optics; Tropics; Vegetation; (SPM) classes; Burnt areas; Comparative analysis; Deciduous forests; Ecological characteristics; ecosystem diversity; fire effects; Fire frequencies; Fire regimes; Fire size; Forest fires; High-frequency (HF); Hot spotting; Hot-spots; Human density; Human disturbances; Low frequency (LF); Metrics (CO); Regeneration (renovating); Remote sensing (RS) data; sapling densities; Significant impacts; Spatial variations; species diversity; temporal trends; tree density; Tropical ecosystems; vegetation types; Fires; biodiversity; comparative study; deciduous forest; dry forest; forest fire; GIS; population decline; population density; remote sensing; sapling; tropical environment; vegetation type; Forest Fires; Hardwoods; Plants; Reforestation; Remote Sensing; Saplings; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Western Ghats","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-46849101504"

Despite incremental improvements in our ability to quantify rates of forest clearing, there is still no definitive understanding on global trends. Without timely and accurate forest monitoring methods, policy responses will be uninformed concerning the most basic facts of forest cover change. Results of a feasible and cost-effective monitoring strategy are presented that enable timely, precise, and internally consistent estimates of forest clearing within the humid tropics. A probability-based sampling approach that synergistically employs low and high spatial resolution satellite datasets was used to quantify humid tropical forest clearing from 2000 to 2005. Forest clearing is estimated to be 1.39% (SE 0.084%) of the total biome area. This translates to an estimated forest area cleared of 27.2 million hectares (SE 2.28 million hectares), and represents a 2.36% reduction in area of humid tropical forest. Fifty-five percent of total biome clearing occurs within only 6% of the biome area, emphasizing the presence of forest clearing ""hotspots."" Forest loss in Brazil accounts for 47.8% of total biome clearing, nearly four times that of the next highest country, Indonesia, which accounts for 12.8%. Over three-fifths of clearing occurs in Latin America and over one-third in Asia. Africa contributes 5.4% to the estimated loss of humid tropical forest cover, reflecting the absence of current agro-industrial scale clearing in humid tropical Africa. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Change detection; Deforestation; Humid tropics; Monitoring; Remote sensing","article; biome; cost effectiveness analysis; forest management; policy; priority journal; tropical rain forest; Geography; Humidity; Satellite Communications; Trees; Tropical Climate","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-48249153413"

In this paper, we report changes in ecosystem services in relation to land use and land cover over an 18-year period (1988-2006) in the Menglun Township, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We used Landsat TM/ETM and Quickbird data sets to estimate changes in ten land use and land cover categories, and generalized value coefficients to estimate changes in the ecosystem services provided by each land category. The results showed that over the 18-year period, the land use and land cover in the study area experienced significant changes. Rubber plantations increased from 12.10% of total land cover to 45.63%, while forested area and swidden field decreased from 48.73 and 13.14 to 27.57 and 0.46%, respectively. During this period, the estimated value of ecosystem services dropped by US $11.427 million (∼27.73%). Further analysis showed that there were significant changes in ecological functions such as nutrient cycling, erosion control, climate regulation and water treatment as well as recreation; the obvious increase in the ecological function is provision of raw material (natural rubber). Our findings conclude that an abrupt shift in land use from ecologically important tropical forests and traditionally managed swidden fields to large-scale rubber plantations result in a great loss of ecosystem services in this area. Further, the study suggests that provision of alternative economic opportunities would help in maintaining ecosystem services and for an appropriate compensation mechanisms need to be established based on rigorous valuation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Biodiversity hotspot; Ecosystem services; Remote sensing; Rubber expansion; Tropical forest; Valuation","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Ecology; Environmental impact; Land use; Landforms; Offshore oil well production; Raw materials; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Water analysis; Water treatment; Biodiversity hotspot; Ecosystem services; Remote sensing; Rubber expansion; Tropical forest; Valuation; Ecosystems; rubber; biodiversity; data set; environmental impact; land cover; land use change; remote sensing; tropical forest; article; China; climate change; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental erosion; environmental management; environmental monitoring; forest management; forest structure; forestry; geographic distribution; land use; landscape; nutrient cycling; plantation; recreation; tropical rain forest; water treatment; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Industry; Spacecraft; Trees; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-53649083931"

The potential consequences of these changes with respect to carbon budgets and climate change (Detwiler and Hall 1988; Gash and Nobre 1996; Zhang, McGuffie, and Henderson-Sellers 1996; Melillo et al. 1996; Steudler et al. 1996), loss of habitat and fear of species extinction (Skole and Tucker 1993; Turner 1996; Prance and Elias 1976), and erosion of indigenous people's rights and ways of living (Vickers 1994; Redford and Padoch 1992), combined with concerns of resource mismanagement and depletion (Myers 1996), have drawn increased attention to the fate of tropical forest ecosystems. The scientific community has called for an intensive effort to highlight and document areas of rapid land-cover change (Turner et al. 1995). These concerns are reflected both in international conventions (IPCC 1996) and in bilateral government actions to reduce the impact of deforestation. The European Union has a stated policy of supporting sustainable forest management and therefore spends several hundred million euros on tropical forest initiatives each year (Shepherd et al. 1998). However, severe criticism has been leveled that aid funding has been counterproductive (Rainforest Foundation 1998), inasmuch as the perceived solutions for rural development are often at odds with forest conservation. One of the most striking examples of this is the extension and improvement of the road systems in the forest domain (FAO 1999; Laurance et al. 2001). In such circumstances, the provision of timely and accurate data on the tropical forest extent and its changes can help to formulate conservation policies and maximize their impact, and at the same time can serve as an important input into development planning. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, which has a mandate to collect and publish global forest statistics, would be in theory such a data source (FAO 2001); however, these data are often difficult to compare between countries due to different classification systems, are not spatially explicit, and in some cases are simply extrapolations of historical data (Matthews 2001). The Joint Research Center of the European Commission initiated the Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite (TREES) project in 1991 to develop a system for the monitoring of the extent, condition, and dynamics of the tropical forest belt at a global level. A crucial goal for the project was to develop techniques for highlighting areas undergoing rapid forest change so that appropriate political action and funding might be efficiently targeted (Malingreau et al. 1995). Over the last twenty years the use of observation satellites has become more commonplace as a remote sensing tool for documenting and estimating changes in land cover. The observations are carried out at different scales: There are fine spatial resolution observations from Landsat Thematic Mapper, for example, where a restricted scene of around 200 km width can be observed at a resolution of 30 m for a selected site once a month; there are also coarse spatial resolution observations from NOAA's advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR), where regional to continental scenes are acquired daily but with a poor spatial definition, at a resolution of about 1 km. While in theory a comprehensive coverage of the tropics using high spatial resolution data would reveal in detail the full extent of deforestation occurring at any one time, in practice the availability of imagery, the costs of acquisition and processing, and the huge amounts of data involved limit such efforts at global levels. The lack of sufficient imagery arises because cloud cover frequently obscures the target area in the tropics, and for a number of regions no ground stations exist, so that on-board satellite data storage is required. The latter depend on the space agencies, or on a paying customer. Coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data have the advantage of giving daily synoptic views over large, often inaccessible areas, allowing phenological analysis of the data. In many cases, near real-time data can be obtained, either through a local receiving station or through the space agencies via the World Wide Web. On the other hand, these data do not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine land-cover area change estimates accurately. In this chapter we describe the methods used to highlight areas of land-cover change in the humid forests of tropical South America, which contains about half of the world's remaining rainforest (Achard et al. 2002). Our objective was to use regional maps of forest cover and fire incidence, both derived from coarse resolution satellite data, in conjunction with expert opinion to highlight the major deforestation fronts in tropical South America. The resulting maps can be used to target projects aimed at supporting sustainable forest management accurately, to support public administration, to monitor the integrity of national parks and indigenous lands, and to focus studies that aim to measure forest change in these ""hotspots."" Our study encompasses the humid tropical forests of South America, which stretch from the Darien Gap in northwestern Colombia down the Choco, and across the Orinoco basin and Amazonian basins to the Guyanas (figure 24.1). On its eastern and southern edge the forest is bordered by the Brazilian cerrado and the Bolivian chaco, originally areas of dry forest and savanna, now predominantly agricultural. South of the equator, the western edge of the forest is delimited by the Andes mountain range. Within the vast humid forest domain of South America several large savannahs exist, notably the llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, the llanos de Mojos of Bolivia, and the Rio Branco/Rupunumi/Gran Sabana on the frontier of Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela. While much of the area of dry forest had been exploited and converted to agriculture in colonial times, the humid forest areas have remained intact until the post-World War II period. Since then, major land-use changes have occurred due to economic growth and outmigration. The latter has arisen for a number of reasons: Isolation from markets and employment opportunities, lack of cultivable land, drought and civil disturbances, and few opportunities for producing cash crops (Preston 1996). The main migratory trends into the forest frontiers have been from the northeast of Brazil and from the Andes. In a number of countries the process has been encouraged by government grants, subsidies, and infrastructure improvements (Fearnside 1983; Nepstad et al. 1997). General economic growth at the national level has also stimulated these infrastructure improvements, leading to the construction and upgrading of ports and roads as well as increased mineral exploration and exploitation, all of which combine to make easier access to-and export from-the forested regions. The FAO forest area statistics show that the annual average net change rate for tropical South America between 1990 and 2000 was of the order of 0.4 percent; however, the data are not specifically spatially located, remaining aggregated at the country level (FAO 2001). There is a need therefore to provide decision makers with explicit information as to just where deforestation is occurring, along with comparative rates for the particular hotspots. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

We assessed the utility of a hybrid classification technique, iterative guided spectral class rejection (IGSCR), for accurately mapping Amazonian deforestation using annual imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) from 1992 to 2002. The mean overall accuracy of the 11 annual classifications was 95% with a standard deviation of 1.4%, and z-score analysis revealed that all classifications were significant at the 0.05 level. The IGSCR thus seems inherently suitable for monitoring forest cover in the Amazon. The resulting classifications were sufficiently accurate to assess preliminarily the magnitude and causes of discrepancies between farmer-reported and satellite-based estimates of deforestation at the household level using a sample of 220 farms in Rôndonia mapped in the field in 1992 and 2002. The field- and satellite-derived estimates were significantly different only at the 0.10 level for the 220 farms studied, with the satellite-derived deforestation estimates 8.9% higher than estimates derived from in situ survey methods. Some of this difference was due to a tendency of farmers to overestimate the amount of forest within their property in our survey. Given the objectivity and reduced expense of satellite-based deforestation monitoring, we recommend that it be an integral part of household-level analysis of the causes, patterns and processes of deforestation.","","Deforestation; Estimation; Mapping; Monitoring; Statistics; Enhanced thematic mapper plus; Hybrid classification technique; Landsat thematic mapper; Satellite imagery; deforestation; forest cover; imagery; mapping; satellite imagery; tropical forest; Satellites; Amazon Basin; South America","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33947390755"

These biodiversity hotspots occupy approximately 0.4% of the Earth's land surface but support 20% and 16% of the Earth's plants and vertebrates, respectively. Survival of these habitats depends strongly on regular and frequent immersion in orographic clouds. However, regional land use change and global climate change has lead to increasing cloud base heights at some of these forest locations. At the Monteverde Cloud Mist Forest Reserve in Costa Rica, the bases of the clouds have shifted upslope, leading to anuran population crashes, an increase in the upper elevation of bird ranges on the Pacific slope, and longer dry season mist-free intervals. Satellite remote sensing techniques have been developed to determine the orographic cloud base heights; these are tested for the dry season month of March 2003 over the Monteverde cloud forests. The approach derives MODIS cloud top pressures and then converts them to cloud top heights using geopotential height profiles. The NCAR Land Use and Cloud Interaction Experiment (LUCIE), consisting of paired mobile radiosonde systems deployed in Costa Rica, provided the means for validating the retrievals. Results show that the four MODIS CO <inf>2</inf> slicing channels do not provide sufficiently accurate cloud top height values, although some of the differences are due to a mismatch in the observational periods. An alternative approach using simulated geopotential height profiles from the CSU Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) initialized with the LUCIE soundings provided superior results. Cloud thicknesses are estimated using three different approaches of: 1) constant liquid water content (CLWC); 2) an empirical relationship; and 3) an adiabatic model. The CLWC approach provided the most consistent results. The cloud base heights are computed from subtracting cloud thickness from cloud top height. Orographic cloud base heights derived from the combined MODIS/RAMS approach were then compared with values observed at the study sites. Differences between the observed and remotely sensed values were on the order of 200m. The results suggest that it is possible to monitor global cloud mist forest cloud base heights using the combination of MODIS satellite imagery with model simulations. Further investigations using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is now being carried out to develop methods that are wholly dependent on satellite observations.","","Adiabatic models; Alternative approach; Atmospheric infrared sounders; Cloud forest; Cloud top heights; Cloud top pressure; Cloud-base height; Costa Rica; Dry seasons; Endangered species; Forest reserves; Geopotential height; Global climate changes; Global clouds; Hotspots; In-situ measurement; Land surface; Land-use change; Liquid water content; Model simulation; Orographic cloud; Regional atmospheric modeling systems; Satellite observations; Satellite remote sensing; Study sites; Biodiversity; Climate change; Clouds; Conservation; Drought; Infrared devices; Infrared instruments; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sounding apparatus; Spectrometers; Water content; Satellite imagery","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868165174"

We explain and predict the spatial variation of α (i.e. within plot) and β (i.e. between plot) tree diversity in a tropical montane landscape subjected to a high deforestation rate. A major aim is to demonstrate the potential of a method that combines data from multiple sources (field data, remote sensing imagery and GIS) to evaluate and monitor forest diversity on a broad scale over large unexplored areas. Location: The study covered an area of c. 3500 km2 in the Highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Methods: We identified all of the tree species within 204 field plots (1000 m2 each) and measured different environmental, human disturbance-related, and spatial variables using remote sensing and GIS data. To obtain a predictive model of α tree diversity (Fisher's alpha) based on selected explanatory variables, we used a generalized linear model with a gamma error distribution. Mantel tests of matrix correspondence were used to determine whether similarities in floristic composition were correlated with similarities in the explanatory variables. Finally, we used a method that combines α and β tree diversity to define priority areas for conservation. Results: The model for α tree diversity explained 44% of the overall variability, of which most was mainly related to precipitation, temperature, NDVI, and canopy (all relationships were positive, and quadratic for temperature and NDVI). There were no spatially structured regional factors that were ignored. Similarity in tree composition was correlated positively with climate and NDVI. Main conclusions: The results were used to: (1) identify and assign conservation priority of unexplored areas that have high tree diversity, and (2) demonstrate the importance of several vegetation formations in the region's biodiversity. The method we present can be particularly useful in assessing regional needs and in developing local conservation strategies in poorly surveyed (and often at risk) tropical areas worldwide, where accessibility is usually limited. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Beta diversity; Fisher's alpha; Generalized linear model; Highlands of Chiapas; Hotspot; Mantel test; Spatial autocorrelation; Tree diversity","deforestation; GIS; remote sensing; spatial variation; species diversity; tropical forest; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]; North America","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750286034"

However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Our study focuses on the rate of loss and patterns of fragmentation in tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, during a 25-year period. Data from Landsat satellite imagery from 1975 (MSS), 1990 (TM) and 2000 (ETM+) were used to ascertain annual deforestation rates of 1.3 and 4.8% for the 1975-1990 and 1990-2000 periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of forest fragmentation were identified using selected landscape indices. Increases in the number of forest fragments (3520-10,542), patch density (1.0-3.2 patches/100 ha), and total edge length (24,781-38,400 km) were associated with decreases in the mean patch size (65.0-8.7 ha), largest patch index (60.7-4.0%), total core area (99,422-9,611 ha), and mean proximity index (101,369-1405). The observed trends indicate increasing deforestation and fragmentation, particularly during the 1990-2000 period. Circa 50% of the forest cover in the Highlands has been lost in 25 years, and a proportion of the remaining forests have been degraded as a result of human use. Increasing human population and a more demanding use of soils for agriculture and timber arise as the major causes of deforestation in the study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should be focused on the management of the natural system and the management of the external influences on it, particularly the detection of hotspots, passive and active restoration and sustainable forest exploitation by the local indigenous communities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Time series analysis of satellite imagery provides an ideal means of quantifying landscape change and identifying the pathways which lead to the changes. This study investigates the forest and land cover changes by classifying Landsat MSS (Multispectral Scanner), TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) images over three time periods (1983-90, 1990-98, and 1998-2000), creating land cover maps for each year and change trajectories for each year-pair. The study area chosen covers an area of 2160 km2 of undulating topography and alluvial plains in the East Kutai District of East Kalimantan Province, which in the 1980s was covered mostly with lowland dipterocarp forest; today the landscape is a patchwork dominated by oil palm and timber plantations and degraded forest. We relate land cover change data to land use allocation and to fire impacts based on fire hotspot distribution and fire damage information. The multidate land cover change trajectories provide an insight into the forest loss and degradation pathways over the 17-year period spanning the first entry of commercial logging concessionaires, followed by a government-sponsored transmigration scheme, government-licensed timber and oil palm plantations and, finally, the devastating fires of 1998. The results show a mean deforestation rate of 42km2 or 6 per cent per year for 1983-2000, rising to 10 per cent per year for 1990-98; by 2000, 70 per cent of forest initially damaged by fire and drought during the 1982-83 El Niño event was classified as non-forest.

By incorporating remote sensing and Geographic Information System technology, this study develops spatial databases used to map current resource conditions and threats to existing biodiversity. Accuracy for landcover mapped with satellite imagery is 94%. Less than 10% of forest remains in large patches which are highly fragmented. The majority of this forest cover is found at high elevations, which correspond to relatively low potential biodiversity. Only 6% of forests are found at high biodiversity, lower elevation zones. More than half of the forest patch edges at these elevations are adjacent to conflicting landcover, such as small-scale agriculture. This information can assist land managers and conservation professionals in the prioritization of protection efforts, conservation management, watershed stabilization, and forest restoration planning.","","Biodiversity; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Mapping; Remote sensing; Watersheds; assessment method; biodiversity; database; developing world; GIS; hot spot; land cover; natural resource; rainforest; remote sensing; Africa; East Africa; Eastern Arc Mountains; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanga [Tanzania]; Tanzania; Usambara Mountains","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746655377"

Refining hotspot conservation means identifying specific locations (individual habitat patches) of realistic size and scale for managers to protect and politicians to support. Because hotspots have lost most of their original habitat, species endemic to them rely on what remains. The issue now becomes identifying where this habitat is and these species are. We accomplished this by using straightforward remote sensing and GIS techniques, identifying specific locations in Brazil's Atlantic Forest hotspot important for bird conservation. Our method requires a regional map of current forest cover, so we explored six popular products for mapping and quantifying forest: MODIS continuous fields and a MODIS land cover (preclassified products), AVHRR, SPOT VGT, MODIS (satellite images), and a GeoCover Landsat thematic mapper mosaic (jpg). We compared subsets of these forest covers against a forest map based on a Landsat enhanced thematic mapper. The SPOT VGT forest cover predicted forest area and location well, so we combined it with elevation data to refine coarse distribution maps for forest endemic birds. Stacking these species distribution maps enabled identification of the subregion richest in threatened birds-the lowland forests of Rio de Janeiro State. We highlighted eight priority fragments, focusing on one with finer resolved imagery for detailed study. This method allows prioritization of areas for conservation from a region >1 million km2 to forest fragments of tens of square kilometers. To set priorities for biodiversity conservation, coarse biological information is sufficient. Hence, our method is attractive for tropical and biologically rich locations, where species location information is sparse. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.","Atlantic Forest; GIS; Hotspots; Prioritization; Remote sensing","biodiversity; conservation planning; GIS; hot spot; prioritization; remote sensing; reserve design; Brazil; South America; Aves","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33244481247"

In response, fire management systems are being developed. This study set out to determine the relationships between two aspects of the fire problems in western Indonesia and Malaysia, and two components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System. The study resulted in a new method for calibrating components of fire danger rating systems based on satellite fire detection (hotspot) data. Once the climate was accounted for, a problematic number of fires were related to high levels of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code. The relationship between climate, Fine Fuel Moisture Code, and hotspot occurrence was used to calibrate Fire Occurrence Potential classes where low accounted for 3% of the fires from 1994 to 2000, moderate accounted for 25%, high 26%, and extreme 38%. Further problems arise when there are large clusters of fires burning that may consume valuable land or produce local smoke pollution. Once the climate was taken into account, the hotspot load (number and size of clusters of hotspots) was related to the Fire Weather Index. The relationship between climate, Fire Weather Index, and hotspot load was used to calibrate Fire Load Potential classes. Low Fire Load Potential conditions (75% of an average year) corresponded with 24% of the hotspot clusters, which had an average size of 30% of the largest cluster. In contrast, extreme Fire Load Potential conditions (1% of an average year) corresponded with 30% of the hotspot clusters, which had an average size of 58% of the maximum. Both Fire Occurrence Potential and Fire Load Potential calibrations were successfully validated with data from 2001. This study showed that when ground measurements are not available, fire statistics derived from satellite fire detection archives can be reliably used for calibration.

Landsat MSS images, which are available only up until 1992, have proved to be an invaluable and cost-effective resource for mapping forest change in the tropics, particularly in large areas. A supervised classification indicates that Jamaica experienced an average annual deforestation rate of 3.9% for this period, a figure higher than existing estimates based on partial ground surveys but lower than the FAO's 1990 Tropical Forest Assessment of 5.3% for 1981-1990. Deforestation estimates for Jamaica's 14 parishes are also presented, based on the integration of satellite-derived forest classification maps with a parish administrative boundaries map of the island in a GIS. A correlation analysis between parish deforestation estimates and socioeconomic and land use/quality indicators derived from official sources suggests that deforestation is occurring most rapidly in highly populated areas possessing large numbers of small farmers who live and work under resource-poor conditions. By providing a sense of the magnitude of and main forest loss hotspots, it is hoped that these national and subnational level forest estimates will draw scientific attention to the problem of deforestation on the island. In addition, the socioeconomic analysis may provide policy-makers and planners with some sense of the relative contribution of underlying driving process in this deforestation as a first step toward the creation of effective social programs to combat the problem.","Human-forest interactions; Jamaica; Satellite remote sensing; Scarcity; Tropical deforestation","Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Geographic information systems; Human engineering; Population statistics; Policy makers; Forestry; deforestation; GIS; nature-society relations; remote sensing; agriculture; cost effectiveness analysis; ecology; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; forest; Jamaica; land use; policy; review; social aspect; socioeconomics; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Developing Countries; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Humans; Policy Making; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Social Class; Trees","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034821940"

The analysis of population trends, topography, and coincident ethnographic research points to a number of different factors influencing deforestation in these regions. Each of these factors generates different problems for conservation and development, most of which are not being dealt with adequately. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","conservation policy; deforestation; development; satellite imagery","anthropology; conservation policy; deforestation; developing country; ecology; ethnographic studies; ethnography; forest conservation; human ecology; rainforest; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Madagascar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028597704"
