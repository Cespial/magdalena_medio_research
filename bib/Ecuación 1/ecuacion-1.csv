While direct deforestation drivers have been analysed, their interactions with socio-economic and land-use dynamics, and the effects of policy interventions remain poorly understood, partly due to limited long-term data. To address this, we present and provide a pan-Amazonian dataset of potential deforestation drivers for the period 1990–2020 and assess their main trends, emergent land-use archetypes, and links to socio-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal a general commoditization of deforestation frontiers—i.e. expansion of export-oriented crops and extractive activities, with regional particularities and different degrees of commoditization. Understanding large-scale patterns of land-use change is key to support policies that effectively address the shifting interactions between deforestation, land-use change, and socio-economic dynamics. These include agricultural and extractive industries’ expansion, migration and armed conflicts in the Amazon, and other frontiers of the Global South. © The Author(s) 2025.","Agricultural frontiers; Cropland expansion; Indigenous Territories; Mining; Protected Areas; Tropical deforestation","biodiversity; biome; climate change; deforestation; mining industry; Amazonia; agriculture; Brazil; ecosystem; environmental protection; socioeconomics; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Socioeconomic Factors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008980765"

Public policy can play a crucial role in combating tropical deforestation, yet gaps in policy formulation, operationalisation, and implementation can hinder its effectiveness. There is currently a lack of detailed analysis on policy gaps, especially concerning tropical deforestation. Our study analysed the policy gaps in a deforestation frontier in the Colombian Amazon during the post-conflict period to enhance our understanding of why public policies might be inadequate in curbing deforestation. This analysis involved identifying potential gaps in the formulation, operationalisation, and implementation of a major national policy framework aimed at controlling deforestation in Colombia. To identify and delineate these policy gaps, we combined secondary literature on deforestation drivers, existing databases, institutional capacity analyses, and national statistics. Our findings indicate that land speculation, a power vacuum, the expansion of pastures, cattle ranching, and infrastructure development are driving tropical deforestation in the study area. Additionally, this process of deforestation is linked to systemic and structural challenges in institutional capacity, broadening policy gaps, such as the exclusion of the main drivers in policy formulation, a lack of local capacity and resources for policy implementation, diverging visions and preferences for regional development, centralisation, and policy obsolescence, which affect both policy operationalisation and implementation. Based on these identified gaps, we discuss potential policy interventions to address them in the study area and other tropical regions. © 2025 The Authors","Environmental policy; Guaviare; Land grabbing; Land speculation; Land tenure; Land use/cover change; Landscape transformation","deforestation; environmental policy; land cover; land tenure; land use change; landscape change; literature review; policy approach; policy implementation; regional development; regional planning; tropical forest; tropical region; Amazonia; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011200049"

The study aims to understand local land use change by incorporating human perceptions as proxies for factors associated with underlying socioeconomic drivers of deforestation in post-conflict priority areas. Community perceptions of socioeconomic dimensions such as education, health, infrastructure, and peacebuilding, among others, were gathered from 98 groups of villages in the Antioquia region of Colombia. This information was categorized and weighted to create three perception-based outlooks: Optimistic (primarily marked by opportunities); Pessimistic (primarily marked by problems); and Neutral. Annual deforestation rate (ADR) data was generated from Landsat imagery, while biophysical and accessibility data came from official sources. Generalized additive models were used to assess the relationship between deforestation and biophysical and socioeconomic factors. The findings indicate that Optimistic outlooks on infrastructure and land adaptation were associated with a 22.59 % lower ADR compared to Neutral ones. Conversely, Optimistic outlooks of housing and sanitation topics were associated to a 19.65 % higher ADR compared to Pessimistic outlooks. Meanwhile, Pessimistic outlooks on reconciliation and peacebuilding topics were associated with a 22.09 % lower ADR than the Neutral. For biophysical factors, temperature differences above 1.4 °C and precipitation differences between 60 and 100 mm were associated with ADR of 1.8 % or higher. Regarding accessibility, the greater the distance to tertiary roads, the lower the ADR, which was below 0.6 % from 5 km onwards. Our approach of combining perceptions with biophysical data provides new insights into the factors associated with the underlying drivers of deforestation at a local level. This provides guidance on which to base land-use policies to protect the region's forests, such raising awareness of the value of forests and fostering community links with them. This approach can be adapted to similar contexts to provide new insights on how human perceptions of socioeconomic dimensions relate to deforestation at scales where data is not yet available. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Community participation; Forest; Land use change; Post-conflict; Public policy; Territory","accessibility; deforestation; housing; infrastructure; land use change; land use planning; Landsat; local participation; peace process; perception; political conflict; precipitation (climatology); sanitation; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; Antioquia [Colombia]; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010533241"

The promotion of African integration has lasted for decades and has also affected cross-border landscape and land use. Since the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement, the processes of forest loss and gain and other land cover change within international borders of continental Africa and its main influencing factors (e.g., active fire) as well as their contribution remain understudied. With the Sentinel-2 10-m land use/land cover products, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fires, LandScan population density, and armed conflict records during 2017-2022, we first examined the inter-annual dynamics and cross-transformations between forest (trees), rangeland (grass and shrub), and bare ground within a total of 146 international borders of the African continent, covering 49 countries. We then determined the major influencing factors and quantified their contribution using Random Forest Regression and correlation analysis. The results show that: (1) the international borders of continental Africa are characterized by a general distribution pattern of forest, rangeland, and bare ground in a sequential order in both the northern and southern parts, divided by the equator. The three land cover types account for nearly 90% of all borders, and dominate (>80%) the change in land cover at the borders with an average annual rate of 2%. Forest loss due to the transformation into rangeland remains a major trend albeit short-term forest gain in 2020. (2) Active fire and population density are the primary and secondary respectively causes of forest cover change along national borders in Africa. The relationship between forest changes and the frequency of active fire or population density is initially weak and then strong during the study period. (3) Nearly 90% of interannual forest loss is strongly and positively correlated with the occurrence of active fires along the international borders of continental Africa, showing a gradual increase on both the northern and southern sides of the equator due to the seasonal dynamics of active fires. (4) Active fires have a more pronounced impact on forest decline within African borders during dry seasons. This study contributes to providing a methodological reference for exploring the causal factors of tropical forest change and the extent to which land-use change at the borders responds to regional integration. © 2025 Science Press.

SLUS also contributes to peacebuilding by providing sustainable income sources and enhancing social cohesion and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation and reduce climate vulnerability. SLUS can contribute to agroecology transition through a cumulative process, boosting adoption rates and encouraging farmers to remain committed to a sustainable process. Despite evidence of their potential and global efforts to promote their use, SLUS adoption rates remain low. Building on traditional ex-post generic adoption studies, we identify the enabling factors for farm-level transitions to SLUS in Colombia to propose policy design that will boost SLUS adoption in areas that are conflict affected and exposed to deforestation. We surveyed a sample of 922 cocoa producers in conflict-affected areas prone to deforestation. To reveal SLUS adoption factors, we (i) classified farmers according to number of sustainable practices applied; (ii) estimated an ordered probit econometric model; and (iii) assessed existing policies to promote cocoa production systems in Colombia, comparing their alignment with the adoption factors identified. We find a mismatch between farm-level adoption factors and policies promoting SLUS in Colombia. The principal factors enabling farm-level adoption of sustainable cocoa production system depend on: (i) cocoa plantation age; (ii) technical assistance provided; (iii) social organization membership; and (iv) farmer-to-farmer interaction, while national policies to promote sustainable cocoa are mostly oriented towards (i) renewing and rehabilitating established farming areas (directly related to crop age); (ii) expanding cocoa agroforestry systems; and (iii) establishing zero-deforestation cocoa production agreements. Our results indicate that to achieve wide-scale SLUS adoption, policies should focus on: (i) capacity building through technical assistance and strengthening farmers’ associations; (ii) strengthening farmer's social organizations, social interactions, and knowledge sharing between producers to generate cascading information (iii) land-use conversion instead of expansion, for example from pastures to cocoa. © 2024 The Authors","Agroforestry; Cocoa; Colombia; Environmental peacebuilding; Farm-level adoption factors","agricultural development; agroforestry; alternative agriculture; cocoa; econometrics; environmental economics; land use; peacekeeping; policy approach; rainfed agriculture; rural economy; sustainable development; vulnerability; Colombia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211165973"

While many analysis using remote sensing identify land cover change, structural connectivity variables are less studied for understanding landscape transformation. In this work, we used data from the Landsat archive from 2011 to 2021, the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC), and Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to analyze deforestation, land cover change, and landscape connectivity in northwestern Colombia's Amazon. We examined the spatial patterns in three specific subsets in the Colombian arc of deforestation, with a special focus on the surroundings of the National Natural Park Serranía de Chiribiquete. Our results confirm changes in structural connectivity linked to pasture expansion from the conversion forest to pasture during the analyzed period showing changes in the borders of Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park along rivers and roads, where cattle is transported. Before 2016, the average annual deforested area in the three study areas was 27.93 km²; after 2016, this number increased to 73.36 km². The outcomes of our study contribute to an improved understanding of pasture dynamics. They can aid decision-making in areas that play a key role in ecological networks necessary for long-term conservation efforts. Our quantitative assessments have revealed a temporal shrinking of the core area, indicative of a decline in forest cover. Concurrently, we observed an expansion of the edge and background areas, which is consistent with the proliferation of pastures.

While much of the analyses of deforestation in the Amazon have been in Brazil, there is a need to extend to Colombia where forest and land use exploitation are driven by post-conflict social and political dynamics. This research contributes to this knowledge gap by unpacking the mechanisms underpinning deforestation on the northwestern side of the Colombian Amazon. We used theory-building process-tracing to guide us in conceptualizing the underlying logics of deforestation in the region through qualitative text analysis of policy documents, articles, reports, and grey literature, and virtual semi-structured interviews with key national, regional and local actors. Findings indicate that the power vacuum resulting from the demobilization of FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), Marxist-Leninist guerrillas, acted as a window of opportunity for peasants, squatters, narco-traffickers, cattle ranchers, landlords, and other investors to access public lands and capitalize from converting forests to coca crops and pastures for cattle ranching. Accumulation of land and surplus primarily from cattle ranching and coca production has increased the ability of these actors to reshape the landscape and societal structures. Traditional elites and old and emerging narco-bourgeoisie have capitalized on preexisting power asymmetries by disproportionally accumulating land, money, gun power, influence, and prestige seeking to consolidate territorial hegemony, and controlling the means for material reproduction in society. Powerful actors use their resources and prestige to displace historically marginalized groups – such as indigenous communities, peasants and squatters – from their means of subsistence and production, resulting in the installation of a capitalist economy based on land rent and drug trafficking, where less powerful and marginalized actors engage in deforestation as means for capital accumulation and subsidizing their peasant and subsistence economies. All this has deepened forest loss, inequalities, and conflict over land access between actors. © (2024), (University of Arizona Libraries).

The underlying causes of these land activities include historical processes of colonization, armed conflict, and narco-trafficking. We aim to examine how illicit cattle ranching and coca farming are driving forest cover change over the last 34 years (1985–2019). To achieve this aim, we combine two pixel-based approaches to differentiate between coca farming and cattle ranching using hypothetical observed patterns of illicit activities and a deep learning algorithm. We found evidence that cattle ranching, not coca, is the main driver of forest loss outside the legal agricultural frontier. There is evidence of a recent, explosive conversion of forests to cattle ranching outside the agricultural frontier and within protected areas since the negotiation phase of the peace agreement. In contrast, coca is remarkably persistent, suggesting that crop substitution programs have been ineffective at stopping the expansion of coca farming deeper into protected areas. Countering common narratives, we found very little evidence that coca farming precedes cattle ranching. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the expansion of illicit land uses reflect the cumulative outcome of agrarian policies, Colombia’s War on Drugs, and the 2016 peace accord. Our study enables the differentiation of illicit land activities, which can be transferred to other regions where these activities have been documented but poorly distinguished spatiotemporally. We provide an applied framework that could be used elsewhere to disentangle other illicit land uses, track their causes, and develop management options for forested land systems and people who depend on them. © 2023, The Author(s).","","cocaine; agricultural land; agriculture; animal; bovine; coca; Colombia; environmental protection; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Coca; Cocaine; Conservation of Natural Resources; Farms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147412301"

The paper develops a theoretical framework of the deforestation process, as determined by the spatiotemporal patterns of socio-economic and conflict related variables. These determinants are examined using a system of spatial dynamic panels by land-use activity, and emphasizing interactions and spatiotemporal lags. The theoretical approach is innovative and applicable to other cases where political, economic and ideological interests interact in deforestation processes. In addition, the methodological structure of our spatial panels allows us to determine the effect of armed conflict agents’ and socio-economic structures, combined and in isolation. Our results formally verify that different armed actors’ strategies and ideologies, determine different and contrasting spatiotemporal patterns of deforestation/conservation, in the context of structural socio-economic determinants in Colombia. We argue about the need of context-specific modelling in any microeconomic or agent-based analysis of deforestation. © 2022 The Author(s)","Cocaine trafficking; Deforestation; Internal armed conflict; Spatial economic analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136671383"

However, less is known on how interacting regional and local-level anthropogenic and ecological disturbances such as land use activities, human populations, and armed conflict affect carbon storage and emissions in Neotropical forests. Therefore, we explored how local-scale, socio-ecological drivers affect carbon dynamics across space and time in a region in Colombia characterized by deforestation, land use cover (LULC) changes, and armed conflict. Specifically, using available municipal level data from a period of armed conflict (2009–2012), spatiotemporal analyses, and multivariate models, we analyzed the effects of a suite of socio-ecological drivers (e.g., armed conflict, illicit crops, human population, agriculture, etc.) on deforestation and carbon storage-emission dynamics. We found that about 0.4% of the initial forest cover area was converted to other LULC types, particularly pastures and crops. Gross C storage emissions were 4.14 Mt C, while gross carbon sequestration was 1.43 Mt C; primarily due to forest regeneration. We found that livestock ranching, illegal crop cultivation, and rural population were significant drivers of deforestation and carbon storage changes, while the influential role of armed conflict was less clear. However, temporal dynamics affected the magnitude of LULC effects and deforestation on carbon storage and emissions. The approach and findings can be used to better inform medium to long-term local and regional planning and decision-making related to forest conservation and ecosystem service policies in Neotropical forests experiencing disturbances related to global change and socio-political events like armed conflict. © © 2022 Toro, Otero, Clerici, Szantoi, González-González and Escobedo.","armed conflict; Colombia; deforestation; ecosystem services; socio-ecological systems; spatiotemporal analyses","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139245364"

This is partly because of the limited local understanding of the causes of forest cover changes (FCC) and how these causes relate to development. In this study, we use Colombia as a model to contribute to the understanding of the links between the causes of FCC in conflict-affected countries and policies aimed at achieving sustainable development by targeting the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectors. Specifically, we reviewed studies reporting on causes of FCC from 1995 to 2019 to build a state-of-the-art review. We then identified relevant public policies targeting AFOLU sectors and used them as a proxy for development. Finally, we discussed the links between these public policies and FCC. From the reviewed literature, it is clear that research on FCC in Colombia has focused on understanding the causes of forest cover losses while disregarding forest cover gains. Although cattle ranching and agriculture dominate the literature as proximate causes of deforestation and policy and institutional factors as underlying causes of deforestation, the relative importance of proximate and underlying causes of FCC in Colombia has changed over time. The main categories of policies that have been linked to FCC deal with conflict and post-conflict issues, coca eradication and, more recently, the implementation of the peace agreement. Another set of policies frequently mentioned are those related to productive activities. In Colombia, these policies' effects on forests will depend on how the state will regulate extractive activities in a post-conflict scenario. Therefore, it is imperative to review and update policies to tackle FCC, mainly deforestation, to successfully achieve sustainability targets in Colombia. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Colombia; Deforestation; Drivers; Peacebuilding; Post-conflict; Public policy","deforestation; forest cover; forestry policy; peace process; peacekeeping; sustainability; sustainable development; Colombia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122939959"

In the Andean region of South America, population growth has been a leading explanation for both deforestation and coca cultivation, but coca generates armed conflict and attracts counter-drug measures, obscuring the differences between population-driven and frontier-open-ing models of deforestation. Using a 15-year panel from Colombia, we model deforestation, coca cultivation, and conflict victims as interrelated responses with a suite of covariates encompass-ing land cover, land cover changes, population, population changes, counter-drug measures, and government infrastructure spending. Infrastructure spending suppresses coca, coca and eradication by aerial fumigation both increase conflict, and conflict promotes deforestation and is associated with depopulation. But the strongest predictor of deforestation is pasture growth, which covaries with coca. While these models show that infrastructure spending can help reduce coca, and coca’s influence on deforestation is indirect and mediated by conflict, the models also reveal the most important challenge to forest conservation is neither coca nor conflict, but an insatiable appetite for land that expresses itself through pasture growth. © 2021 The Author(s).","Amazon-Andes; armed conflict; coca; Colombia; development; infrastructure; pastures","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129091517"

Much attention is placed on the forest conservation impact of these interventions in areas where commodity production constitutes a main driver of deforestation. It is, however, less clearly understood what role they could play in areas where the production of commodities is not evidently leading to the loss of forest and how they could contribute to other objectives including sustainable rural development and peacebuilding. In this paper, we examine the potential of the cocoa sector in Colombia in achieving deforestation reduction and peacebuilding simultaneously, as aimed by the country's Cocoa, Forests and Peace Initiative. Results from correlations and spatially explicit analyses show that regardless of its widespread production across Colombia, in the past fifteen years cocoa has not been an important driver of deforestation. This suggests that efforts to end deforestation in the Colombian cocoa sector emerged following global trends, and not because of an evident link between cocoa production and deforestation. Furthermore, results from spatial clustering analyses highlight areas where different types of value chain interventions may be appropriate to parallel forest conservation and peacebuilding, while interviews with key actors in the cocoa sector provide clues as to how these interventions should be developed and implemented. Specifically, our results show that narratives around approaches to achieve zero deforestation from agricultural commodities should (1) be adjusted to local contexts, (2) incorporate location-specific development needs, (3) complement existing rural development efforts, (4) enhance collaboration among actors that operate both within and beyond the value chain, and (5) apply high-resolution data to assess deforestation-commodity relations and verify zero-deforestation commitments. These considerations are particularly relevant in contexts where commodity production is not evidently leading to deforestation, as in the case of cocoa production in Colombia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural commodity; Land use change; Peacebuilding; Value chain; Zero deforestation","cocoa; deforestation; nature conservation; peace process; private sector; supply chain management; sustainability; Colombia; Theobroma cacao","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088649311"

In this process rural land-use is being transformed, generating new conflicts over land use and control with detrimental effects on Colombia's forests. Based on official documents, reports, existing scholarly work, interviews and observations collected during fieldwork in the Colombian Amazon, I analyze the ways in which peace-building and post-conflict transition have precipitated factors which have aggravated land conflicts and led to the escalation of deforestation in Colombia. I argue that Colombia's current REDD+ efforts mainly serve to attract international funding and legitimize the status quo since they remain disconnected from the structural processes that directly and indirectly drive deforestation. As such, REDD+ in Colombia contributes to a contradictory neoliberal approach to development, which promises to safeguard the environment, while supporting large-scale extractive industries, mining, cattle ranching and intensive agriculture, resulting in the increase in deforestation and forest degradation. © 2020 University of Arizona Libraries.","Colombia; Deforestation; Extractivism; Peace-building; Post-conflict; REDD+","deforestation; environmental degradation; fieldwork; forest management; governance approach; intensive agriculture; peacekeeping; Colombia; Bos","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086841100"

Myanmar was long an exception to this trend–until recent policy reforms put economic development at the forefront. Under ambiguous land rights, commercial agriculture has spread rapidly, causing an unprecedented loss of biodiversity-rich forest. In south-eastern Myanmar, where land tenure is highly contested due to several decades of conflict, scientific evidence on these complex social-ecological processes is lacking. In the absence of past satellite data, we applied a participatory mapping approach and co-produced annual land use information with local land users between 1990 and 2017 for two case study landscapes. Results show that both landscapes have undergone a land use regime shift from small-scale farmers’ shifting cultivation to plantations of rubber, betel nut, cashew, and oil palm. These changes are likely to have long-term impacts on land users’ livelihoods and the environment. We call for a reconsideration of land governance arrangements and concerted land use planning that respects the rights of local land users and strengthens their role as environmental stewards. Applied with careful facilitation, participatory mapping could be an important tool to engage communities in the highly challenging process of transforming land governance to achieve more sustainable outcomes in this post-conflict context. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Its association with factors like illegal crop cultivation can obscure its effect on deforestation patterns. We used Colombia, a global biodiversity hotspot with a complex political history, to explore the association of both armed conflict and coca cultivation with deforestation patterns. We generated spatial predictions of deforestation pressure based on the period 2000–2015 to understand how armed conflict and coca cultivation are associated with spatial patterns of deforestation and assess the spatial distribution of deforestation pressure induced by armed conflict and coca cultivation. Deforestation was positively associated with armed conflict intensity and proximity to illegal coca plantations. A deforestation model including 14 variables was 78% accurate in predicting deforestation at a 10 km2 resolution. On their own armed conflict and coca cultivation had a notable effect, particularly in the Amazon, but in combination with other variables it was small. Deforestation pressure induced by armed conflict and coca cultivation was highest in Tumaco and Catatumbo regions and in la Macarena, Sierra Nevada and San Lucas mountains—all areas of high biodiversity and conservation importance. In some regions, lack of governance after the peace accords is increasing armed conflict, and our results suggest that those increases in conflict may increase deforestation in those areas.

Deforestation is presented as one of the most common negative environmental impacts resulting from armed conflicts, with relevant consequences in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and loss of ecosystem services. However, the impact of armed conflict on forests is complex and may simultaneously lead to positive and negative environmental outcomes, i.e. forest regrowth and deforestation, in different regions even within a country. We investigate the impact that armed conflict exerted over forest dynamics at different spatial scales in Colombia and for the global tropics during the period 1992–2015. Through the analysis of its internally displaced population (departures) our results suggest that, albeit finding forest regrowth in some municipalities, the Colombian conflict predominantly exerted a negative impact on its forests. A further examination of georeferenced fighting locations in Colombia and across the globe shows that conflict areas were 8 and 4 times more likely to undergo deforestation, respectively, in the following years in relation to average deforestation rates. This study represents a municipality level, long-term spatial analysis of the diverging effects the Colombian conflict exerted over its forest dynamics over two distinct periods of increasing and decreasing conflict intensity. Moreover, it presents the first quantified estimate of conflict's negative impact on forest ecosystems across the globe.

Spatial and statistical analyzes where used to study the landcover change in and around LRP areas at the national and regional level. An index of naturalness using a multi-criteria framework was used to identify important areas for conservation. Within areas, forest cover changes, resulting from deforestation and regeneration processes, decreased between 1990 and 2017. A total of 9.4% of their area show high naturalness, while 20% of them show high importance for conservation. The results show that, despite their dispossession/abandonment, these areas continued a deforestation process. Most of the areas show low naturalness, but conservation priorities can be identified in the Andes, Amazon, and Orinoco regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Armed conflict; Conservation; Land restitution; LULCC; MCDA","conservation management; deforestation; forest cover; knowledge; land cover; land management; land use planning; naturalness; political conflict; regeneration; spatial analysis; Amazon River; Andes; Colombia; Orinoco River","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064107446"

Interactions between direct (proximate or direct causes) and indirect (underling or indirect causes) drivers could cluster these forest cover changes forming hotspots (areas that exhibit significant spatial correlation of deforestation or reforestation transitions). Using land use–land cover maps and global (I) and local (I<inf>i</inf>) Moran's tests, we identified these hotspots in the Chocó-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE) of South America, a natural region that was declared one of the top 25 hotspots for conservation priorities in the world. Subsequently, we tested and studied the effects and interactions between deforestation and reforestation hotspots and their direct and indirect drivers using Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (Bayesian SEM). We found that deforestation and reforestation were spatially auto-correlated forming hotspots (I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions and I = 0.48, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Also, hotspots of deforestation and reforestation were auto-correlated within municipality borders (I = 0.5, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions; I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Eighteen municipalities located on the border between Colombia and Ecuador showed significant aggregations of deforestation hotspots, while thirty-four municipalities in three areas of Colombia and the area between the Colombian and Ecuadorian border showed significant clustering of reforestation hotspots. Eleven of these municipalities presented significant clustering of both reforestation and deforestation hotspots. The Bayesian SEM for deforestation showed that population growth and road density were indirect drivers of deforestation hotspots (0.191 and 0.127 standard deviation units). The Bayesian SEM for reforestation found that armed conflicts, Gross Domestic Product, and average annual rain were indirect drivers related to reforestation hotspots (0.228, 0.076, and 0.081 standard deviation units, respectively). Our assessment shows a novel methodology to study interactions among direct and indirect drivers of forest change and their potential dissimilar effects on forest transitions. © 2019 The Authors.","Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling; deforestation; hotspots; Moran's test; reforestation; spatial autocorrelation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077294923"

For instance, mangroves are extensive along the Pacific coast due to both high annual rainfall rates and the presence of many world-class deltas. Besides, they are the habitat of the only Neotropical endemic mangrove (Pelliciera rhizophorae), which is also a threatened species. In contrast, mangroves are discontinuously distributed along the Caribbean coast and they are extensive in the three major deltas and a few coastal lagoons. In addition, dwarf and stunt mangroves are found in northern arid lands sprung by seasonal streams and rivers. Recent studies have highlighted the global significance of the Colombian mangroves in terms of their extension, low deforestation rates (particularly in the Pacific coast), and high reservoirs of ecosystem carbon scattered nation-wide. Nonetheless, most of the current understanding of the biogeography of our mangroves has been obtained by integrating studies independently conducted in different sites and years. The voluminous information collected by Heliodoro Sánchez-Páez and his colleagues in the largest national inventory of mangroves (MCP: Mangroves of Colombia Project, Ministry of the Environment) undertaken in the mid 1990's provides an opportunity to re-assess biogeographic hypotheses (e.g., that high rainfall promotes the increase in the importance value of red mangroves) and to explore macroecological patterns when combined with open data sets. The objective of this paper was to introduce HELIO_SP.CO v.1, an open database derived from this mangrove inventory as a homage to Heliodoro Sánchez-Páez, who passed away in 2017, as a platform for macroecological studies and benchmark for future impact assessments of climate change and land-use change on mangroves in Colombia. In addition, the contributions of the MCP were reviewed and the general geographic patterns were explored by using HELIO_SP.CO v.1. For instance, the shift of the two dominant mangrove species in Colombia across the rainfall gradient observed from Nariño to La Guajira was clearly depicted. Using WorldClim 2, we also explored the rainfall and temperature spaces where the species occur. Finally, we briefly reviewed the progress of mangrove science since 1997 and identified some challenges regarding climate change and post-armed conflict scenarios in Colombia. © 2018 Revista de la Academia Colombiana de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales.All right reserved.","Avicennia germinans; Biogeography; Climatic space; HELIO_SP.CO v.1; Laguncularia racemosa; Macroecology; Pelliciera rhizophorae; Post-conflict; Rhizophora spp","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064241408"

Landsat images of 1986, 1990, 2002 and 2016 were classified into four dominant land use categories in the study area: cultivation, mine, forest and settlement using maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Land use change was determined by deriving pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict transition matrix. Based on the transition matrix, gain, loss, persistence, total change, swap and absolute value of net change were computed. Intensity of land use change was determined using the intensity analysis approach. The results show that the intensity of land use change was slow during the conflict but increased sharply after the conflict. Pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict mine occupied 0.63%, 0.78% and 17.68%, forest cover accounted for 71.08%, 69.26% and 56.42% and settlement was 1.99%, 1.96% and 25.63% respectively. Similarly, pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict uniform intensity of land use change was 4.09%, 1.51% and 5.01% respectively. Recent forest cover loss is primarily driven by sustained settlement expansion. The implications of rapid post-conflict settlement increase and forest loss in northern Nimba County include threat to habitat in a globally important biodiversity hotspot, increasing pressure on available agricultural land because of increasing population and potential exposure of the population to pollution from increase in mining activities. Therefore, more effective forest management strategies need to be developed to mitigate the prevailing trend. The use of intensity analysis has provided insights on the patterns and processes of pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict land use change in a biodiversity hotspot. This is important for defining effective conservation goals, planning sustainable conservation strategies and deploying relevant tools for forest conservation and governance in conflict and conflict prone areas. © 2019 The Authors","Armed conflict; Biodiversity hotspot; Liberia; Nimba nature reserve; Tropical rainforest","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063154477"

Yet, the relationships and dependencies of underlying deforestation drivers are not well understood. For an adequate territorial reorganization in the post-conflict era that is sensitive to local context, a targeted analysis of the present situation at the local level is required. This study investigates direct and indirect deforestation drivers, relationships among these and potential measures to lower deforestation post-conflict. The analysis uses spatial data of the Global Forest Watch project as a starting point for semi-structured interviews with 25 locally and regionally engaged stakeholders, triangulated with existing literature on the social, political and economic situation in the region. The results suggest that deforestation is not only caused by uncontrolled land colonization, but also related to the armed conflict, specifically the eradication of illicit crops and waves of migration due to the displacement of communities. Interviewees stressed the ambiguous role of armed groups and the responsibility of the state in incentivizing deforestation through building roads for the oil industry, fostering extractive industries and cattle ranching. The study reveals a high level of uncertainty among stakeholders regarding the possible effects of the peace agreement between the government and the FARC. Interviewees emphasized the crucial role of good governance and state sovereignty when working towards the establishment of alternative profitable industries, the implementation of environmental compensation schemes and an increased investment into environmental education. © 2018 The Authors","Armed conflict; Ecosystem services; Forest protection; Land use; Post-conflict","armed forces; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental education; environmental protection; governance approach; government; land use conflict; peace process; regional planning; stakeholder; territorial planning; Amazonia; Colombia; Bos","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048193701"

We found that (1) deforestation and land use conflicts were frequent impacts in both conflict and post-conflict scenarios, that (2) return of displaced population, the infectiveness of land use planning, and the dependence on the primary sector were frequent drivers of environmental change; and that (3) natural resources extraction tends to be intensified in post-conflict period. We discuss these findings in light of the current environmental problems of Colombia and the post-conflict environmental challenges. We conclude that in order to ensure environmental sustainability in post-conflict scenario, Colombia should act on structural aspects that go beyond the environmental objectives proposed in the peace agreement between the government and FARC: strengthening environmental institutions, integrating long-term environmental objectives across all sectors, and deintensifying the dependence of the economy in the extractive sector. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Armed conflicts; Colombia; Environmental impacts; Environmental sustainability; Natural resources extraction; Post-conflict countries; Social metabolism","environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental restoration; government; land use conflict; land use planning; metabolism; natural resource; prioritization; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; Colombia","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014117559"

These systems had yet to be described in the literature, especially their potential in terms of biodiversity conservation. The systems studied are located in a post-conflict area, and a deforestation front in Colombian Amazonia. Cacao cropping systems are of key importance in Colombia: cacao plays a prime role in post conflict resolution, as cacao is a legal crop to replace illegal crops; cacao agroforests are expected to be a sustainable practice, promoting forest-friendly land use. Material and methods We worked in 50 x 2000 m2 agroforest plots, in Colombian Amazonia. A cluster analysis was used to build a typology based on 28 variables characterised in each plot, and related to diversity, composition, spatial structure and light availability for the cacao trees. We included variables related to light availability to evaluate the amount of transmitted radiation to the cacao trees in each type, and its suitability for cacao ecophysiological development. Main results We identified 4 types of cacao agroforests based on differences concerning tree species diversity and the impact of canopy spatial structure on light availability for the cacao trees in the understorey. We found 127 tree species in the dataset, with some exclusive species in each type. We also found that 3 out of the 4 types identified displayed an erosion of tree species diversity. This reduction in shade tree species may have been linked to the desire to reduce shade, but we also found that all the types described were compatible with good ecophysiological development of the cacao trees. Main conclusions and prospects Cacao agroforest systems may actually be achieving biodiversity conservation goals in Colombian Amazonia. One challenging prospect will be to monitor and encourage the conservation of tree species diversity in cacao agroforest systems during the development of these cropping systems, as a form of forest-friendly management enhancing sustainable peace building in Colombia. © 2018 Suárez Salazar et al.

These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Angolan civil war; Land use change; Landsat; LandTrendr; Shifting cultivation; Sub-Saharan Africa; Time series analysis","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Pixels; Population statistics; Time series analysis; Civil war; Land-use change; LANDSAT; LandTrendr; Shifting cultivations; Sub-saharan africa; Cultivation; biodiversity; biomass; civil war; deforestation; disturbance; dry forest; ecosystem service; farming system; forest ecosystem; fragmentation; land use change; Landsat; nature-society relations; population growth; remote sensing; rural population; segmentation; selective logging; shifting cultivation; smallholder; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; time series; Angola; Sub-Saharan Africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018465194"

A post-conflict context would open up the possibility of modernizing agriculture, improving living standards in rural areas and making good use of the vast natural resources. Sustainable bioenergy combined with improved land use strategies is of particular interest in this context. However, while bioenergy is today the second largest renewable resource after hydropower, no official plans exist for exploiting it in a post-conflict context. Our study investigates the impacts that an accelerated deployment of bioenergy could have in Colombia until 2030, under different land use pathways. Firstly, we review the country's socioeconomic, land use, energy and emissions context. Then, we identify lessons that Colombia could learn from Brazil to accomplish the proposed targets. Secondly, we explore various scenarios deploying different technologies (bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, biomethane and biomass-based power generation & CHP) and land use pathways that are likely to be implemented in a post-conflict scenario (zero deforestation, agricultural intensification and extensification). Thirdly, we analyze variations in energy demand and supply, greenhouse gas emissions, land use change and biofuel trade. We find that biomethane and biomass-based power generation & CHP could reduce emissions more effectively than first-generation biofuels. However, their abatement is only 5% relative to a baseline scenario. Combining all bioenergy technologies with zero deforestation, agricultural intensification and extensification could boost abatements up to 280%, a value four times higher than the national commitments by 2030. Our study shows that relatively simpler land use and energy models using free software can produce results of quality comparable to more complex and widely accepted models (e.g. IAMs). These results might be helpful to policymakers evaluating the role of bioenergy in a post-conflict context and to other developing countries with significant bioenergy potential and similar conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural intensification; Bioenergy; Biofuels; Deforestation; Energy modeling; Energy policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use change; Post-conflict","Bioethanol; Biomass; Developing countries; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Agricultural intensification; Bio-energy; Biomethane; Colombia; Energy model; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-use strategies; Landuse change; Post-conflict; Power- generations; Deforestation","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010403663"

Protected areas have been the most common strategy for reducing habitat and species loss. Effective conservation planning requires current information on land change dynamics, and the factors driving these changes. Therefore, our main goal was to assess the implications of land change on present and future protected areas. Specifically, we identified hotspots of reforestation and deforestation in Colombia between 2001 and 2010, and we determined the factors that explained land change within these hotspots. We identified four reforestation hotpots located mainly in the highlands of the Andes, and four deforestation hotpots that were located in the lowlands. Environmental and armed conflict variables explained most of the variation in the woody vegetation and agriculture/pasture classes, respectively. Although protected areas cover 12% of the country, only 4% of the reforestation and deforestation hotspots included protected areas. In Colombia, as well as the rest of the world, the majority of protected lands occur in remote regions where there are little to no economic activities and threats. Although we recognize the importance of this conservation approach, particularly for long-term conservation of large areas, we believe that complementary approaches that incorporate current land change dynamics are essential for future protected area planning. These approaches would place higher value on establishing new protected areas in regions that are undergoing rapid land change or regions where agricultural activities have been abandoned and ecosystems are beginning to recovery. The first approach would have immediate conservation benefits, while the second approach could bring ecosystem benefits in the short to intermediate-term and biodiversity benefits in the medium to long-term. These complementary approaches can provide helpful information for protected area conservation planning in a world with rapid land change. © 2013 Sanchez-Cuervo and Aide.","Armed conflict; Conservation; Forest change; Globalization; National parks; Spatial pattern analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901051166"

Furthermore, most studies are conducted at a single spatial scale, and few have included variables related with internal socio-political conflicts. Here we evaluated the effect of environmental, demographic, and socio-economic variables on woody cover change in Colombia between 2001 and 2010 at the country, biome, and ecoregion scales. We also incorporated factors that reflect the unique history of Colombia such as the presence of illegal-armed groups and forced human displacement. Environmental variables explained the patterns of deforestation and forest regrowth at all scales because they can restrict or encourage different land uses across multiple spatial scales. Demographic variables were important at the biome and ecoregion scales and appear to be a consequence of the armed conflict, particularly through forced human displacement (for example, rural-urban migration), which in some areas has resulted in forest regrowth. In other areas, the impact of illegal armed groups has reduced forest cover, particularly in areas rich in gold and lands appropriate for cattle grazing. This multi-scale and multivariate approach provides a new insight into the complex relationship between woody cover change and land abandonment triggered mainly by armed conflict. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","armed conflict; forced displacement; forest change; land abandonment; multiple spatial scales; multivariate approach","biome; cattle; deforestation; ecoregion; ecosystem response; forest cover; grazing pressure; multivariate analysis; regrowth; social conflict; Colombia; Bos","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881555264"

Historical changes in the Colombian landscape have been dramatic, but the magnitude and rate of change has increased over the last half century, while conflict has consumed the capacity of Colombian society to respond to environmental threats. Academic experts in the study of the Colombian conflict have explored the social, political, and economic implications of the war. However, the environmental consequences of conflict are documented only when groups in conflict target salient economic resources. This paper presents the first analysis of the geographic distribution of forest remnants in relation to armed conflict in Colombia. Results show that guerrillas and/or paramilitaries range throughout areas of human encroachment into remnant forests. The policies promoted by Colombia's irregular armed forces range from “gunpoint conservation” rarely applied by guerrillas, to the rapid conversion of forests and crops to cattle ranches and coca (Erythroxylum sp.) plantations, following paramilitary occupation.
