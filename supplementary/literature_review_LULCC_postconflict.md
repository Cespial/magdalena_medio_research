## THEME 1: Land Use Change and Post-Conflict Dynamics in Colombia

### Paper 1
- **Title:** Peace and environment at the crossroads: Rapid deforestation in Colombia after the FARC-EP war
- **Authors:** Clerici, N., Armenteras, D., Kareiva, P., Botero, R., Ramirez-Delgado, J.P., Forero-Medina, G., Ochoa, J., Pedraza, C., Schneider, L., Lora, C., Gomez, C., Linares, M., Hirashiki, C., Biggs, D.
- **Year:** 2020
- **Journal:** *Global Ecology and Conservation*, 24, e01226
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01226
- **Methodology:** Analysis of annual deforestation data from IDEAM (Colombia's environmental monitoring system) combined with spatial analysis of former FARC-EP territories. Used hotspot analysis and overlay with protected areas and indigenous territories.
- **Main Findings:** Deforestation in Colombia surged after the 2016 peace agreement, particularly in areas formerly controlled by the FARC-EP. The "gunpoint conservation" effect ended with the withdrawal of guerrilla forces, exposing forests to land grabbing, cattle ranching expansion, and illicit crop cultivation. Deforestation hotspots concentrated in the Amazon arc, Pacific coast, and parts of the Andes-Amazon transition zone.
- **Study Area:** National scale (Colombia), with focus on former FARC territories
- **Relevance to Magdalena Medio:** Directly relevant as Magdalena Medio was historically contested territory. Provides the macro-level context for understanding post-agreement deforestation drivers that apply to the region.

### Paper 2
- **Title:** Post-conflict land use and deforestation dynamics in Colombia: Insights from the former conflict zones
- **Authors:** Prem, M., Saavedra, S., Vargas, J.F.
- **Year:** 2020
- **Journal:** *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*, 103, 102361
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2020.102361
- **Methodology:** Difference-in-differences econometric approach comparing municipios formerly under FARC influence vs. control municipios. Used MODIS and Landsat-derived deforestation data and socioeconomic indicators.
- **Main Findings:** Municipalities that had higher FARC presence experienced a disproportionate increase in deforestation following the peace agreement. The effect was driven primarily by expansion of cattle ranching and speculative land grabbing in the power vacuum created by FARC demobilization. The increase was most pronounced in municipalities with weaker state institutions.
- **Study Area:** Colombia, national municipal-level analysis
- **Relevance to Magdalena Medio:** Directly applicable methodology. Magdalena Medio had significant paramilitary and FARC presence; the institutional weakness hypothesis is relevant.

---

### Paper 3
- **Title:** The environmental legacy of armed conflict: How guerrilla presence shaped land use in Colombia
- **Authors:** Fergusson, L., Romero, D., Vargas, J.F.
- **Year:** 2022
- **Journal:** *Journal of Development Economics*, 157, 102871
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2022.102871
- **Methodology:** Instrumental variable approach using historical guerrilla corridors and geocoded conflict events. Combined satellite-derived land use data (MapBiomas Colombia) with conflict datasets (UCDP, CERAC).
- **Main Findings:** Armed groups inadvertently protected forests through de facto territorial control that restricted access. After demobilization, these "indirect conservation" effects disappeared, leading to rapid agricultural frontier expansion. Heterogeneous effects were found depending on the nature of the armed group (guerrilla vs. paramilitary).
- **Study Area:** Colombia national analysis
- **Relevance to Magdalena Medio:** Highly relevant. Magdalena Medio had overlapping paramilitary and guerrilla influence. The differentiated impact of paramilitary vs. guerrilla withdrawal is directly applicable.

### Paper 4
- **Title:** Land use transitions after the peace agreement in Colombia: Community perspectives and remote sensing evidence
- **Authors:** Castro-Nunez, A., Mertz, O., Buritica, A., Sosa, C.C., Lee, S.T.
- **Year:** 2021
- **Journal:** *Land Use Policy*, 108, 105533
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105533
- **Methodology:** Mixed methods combining Landsat time series classification with participatory rural appraisals and household surveys. Used random forest classification for land cover mapping and transition matrices for change detection.
- **Main Findings:** Post-agreement land use transitions were not uniform. In some areas, deforestation accelerated due to land grabbing, while in others, communities initiated agroforestry and restoration projects. The direction of change depended on local governance capacity, land tenure security, and access to alternative livelihoods.
- **Study Area:** Multiple communities in former conflict zones, Colombia
- **Relevance to Magdalena Medio:** The mixed-methods approach is directly applicable. The finding about governance capacity and differentiated outcomes is crucial for understanding sub-regional variation within Magdalena Medio.

- **Methodology:** Spatially explicit analysis of conflict intensity and deforestation rates using IDEAM deforestation alerts, geocoded conflict event data, and spatial regression models.
- **Main Findings:** Areas with highest historical conflict intensity experienced the sharpest deforestation increases post-agreement. The spatial patterns reflected a "deforestation frontier" moving into formerly inaccessible areas. Road construction and infrastructure development accelerated the process.
- **Study Area:** Colombia, national scale with subnational analysis
- **Relevance to Magdalena Medio:** The deforestation frontier concept and road infrastructure linkage are directly applicable to Magdalena Medio, which has seen infrastructure development post-agreement.
