\begin{itemize}
\item Forest cover declined ${\sim}$21\% ($\pm$18\%) in Magdalena Medio (2013--2024), from ${\sim}$2,021,000~ha to ${\sim}$1,591,000~ha.
\item Post-agreement deforestation accelerated to 4.1\%~yr$^{-1}$ for dense forest during 2020--2024.
\item Carbon stocks declined from $435 \pm 76$ to $374 \pm 74$~Tg~C, a net loss of ${\sim}$61~Tg~C (${\sim}$222~Mt~CO$_2$); Monte Carlo $P(\text{net loss}) = 0.953$.
\item Multi-product cross-validation (5 datasets) confirmed directional consistency of forest decline.
\item Geographically weighted regression ($R^2 = 0.188$ vs.\ OLS $R^2 = 0.121$) revealed spatially varying deforestation drivers along river corridors.
\end{itemize}
