Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled **"Post-conflict land use transitions and ecosystem service loss in Colombia's Magdalena Medio: A multi-temporal remote sensing analysis (2012–2024)"** for consideration for publication in your journal.

**Significance:** This study addresses a critical gap in understanding the environmental consequences of peace processes in tropical landscapes. While Colombia's 2016 peace agreement with the FARC has received substantial academic attention regarding its socioeconomic dimensions, the land use and ecosystem service implications in key post-conflict regions remain poorly documented. The Magdalena Medio—previously identified as a deforestation hotspot but lacking comprehensive multi-class LULC analysis—provides a compelling case study of the "paradox of peace" phenomenon.

**Novelty and contribution:**

1. **First comprehensive multi-class LULCC study** of the Magdalena Medio region spanning the pre- to post-peace agreement period (2012–2024), addressing a documented geographic gap in the post-conflict deforestation literature that has overwhelmingly focused on the Colombian Amazon and Pacific regions.

2. **Integrated analytical framework** combining Google Earth Engine-based Random Forest classification (Landsat 8/9 + Sentinel-2, 12 spectral-topographic features), IPCC Tier 1 ecosystem service estimation, Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, Geographically Weighted Regression for spatially varying driver identification, and CA-Markov future scenario modeling—providing a comprehensive methodology for post-conflict landscape assessment.

3. **Quantified ecosystem service losses**: a net 190 Mt C carbon stock decline (−33.5%) and habitat quality reduction from 0.247 to 0.168 (2013–2020), with 986,100 ha of dense forest converting to pasture in the 2020–2024 period alone—directly attributable to post-conflict land use transitions.

4. **Actionable scenario projections** for 2030 and 2040 under three governance pathways (business-as-usual, conservation, PDET implementation), demonstrating that the conservation scenario can achieve 72.5% dense forest coverage by 2040 versus 60.9% under BAU—providing evidence that governance choices will substantially determine the region's environmental trajectory.

**Key findings:**
- Total forest cover (dense + secondary) declined 43.9% between 2013 and 2024 (2,599,275 to 1,457,337 ha)
- 454 statistically significant deforestation hotspot cells identified at 99% confidence
- GWR substantially outperformed OLS (R² = 0.609 vs. 0.143), confirming spatial non-stationarity in deforestation drivers with elevation, LST, and distance to rivers as key predictors
- The study honestly addresses methodological limitations, including moderate classification accuracies (57–66% OA), IPCC Tier 1 carbon estimation uncertainties, and temporal consistency considerations

**Relevance to the journal:** This manuscript addresses the intersection of conflict resolution, land governance, environmental sustainability, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 6, 13, 15, 16), examining how post-conflict territorial development frameworks can integrate environmental sustainability.

**Ethical compliance:** All data sources are publicly available satellite imagery and open-access datasets accessed through Google Earth Engine. No human subjects or field data collection involving communities was conducted. Conflict-related data are used at aggregated municipal levels.

**Declarations:** The manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved the manuscript for submission.

We believe this work will be of significant interest to your readership and look forward to your consideration.

Sincerely,
